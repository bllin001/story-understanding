The militant "Islamic State" group has claimed responsibility for an attack on a Catholic church in eastern Congo, leaving more than 40 people dead. The attack put an end to months-long calm in the region.

At least 43 people were killed in the Democratic Republic of Congo after a Catholic church was attacked on Sunday.

Officials initially reported that Islamist Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels had carried out the attack in which terrorists raided the church located in the northeastern town of Komanda as worshippers gathered for prayer.

Later on Monday, the self-named "Islamic State" group (IS) announced on the messaging app Telegram that it had been behind the deadly incident.

What do we know about the attack on the Catholic church?

Nine children were among those killed, according to MONUSCO, the UN peacekeeping mission in the country.

According to reports, houses and shops surrounding the church were also set ablaze by the rebels.

"These targeted attacks on defenseless civilians, especially in places of worship, are not only revolting but also contrary to all norms of human rights and international humanitarian law," the mission's deputy chief, Vivian van de Perre, said in a statement.

Congo military denounces attack

Sunday's attack marked the end of a months-long period of calm in the region of Ituri, bordering Uganda.

In February, 23 people had died in an attack by the ADF in the province's Mambasa territory.

The Congolese military condemned what it described as a "large-scale massacre" on Sunday.

It said the ADF had decided to take "revenge on defenseless peaceful populations to spread terror."

Eastern Congo is considered one of the world's most dangerous regions.

Nearly 130 different armed groups are said to be active across the country, many of which are focused on controlling the region's vast and valuable reserves of natural resources like coltan, cobalt, gold and diamonds.

Hostilities earlier this year between Congolese forces and the M23 rebel group ended in a truce on July 19.

Who are the ADF?

The ADF is a long-standing insurgent group originating in Uganda and operating in eastern Congo. They have been responsible for the killings of thousands of civilians.

The group often uses hatchets and machetes to carry out attacks. In 2019, the ADF pledged allegiance to the "Islamic State" group.

Congo and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have signed a preliminary ceasefire aimed at facilitating a peace agreement to be signed in August. The African Union called the signing a "significant development."

Representatives from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Rwanda-backed M23 militia signed a provisional ceasefire in Qatar on Saturday, committing both sides to signing a permanent truce and a comprehensive peace agreement no later than August 18.

"This marks a major milestone in the ongoing efforts to achieve lasting peace, security and stability in eastern DRC and the wider Great Lakes region," said African Union (AU) Chair Mahmoud Ali Youssouf in a statement.

Saturday's "agreement to principles" deal aligns with a peace deal that both sides signed in Washington on June 27.

What are the terms of the Congo-M23 ceasefire?

Congo's mineral-rich east has seen decades of fighting with M23 emerging as the most prominent of some 100 or so armed groups operating in the region.

At the moment, it is unclear what the specific terms of the final deal will encompass and what concessions have been agreed to. M23 has pushed for the release of captured fighters, whereas Congo has demanded the withdrawal of M23 troops from territories the group has seized.

Saturday's statement said the two sides would refrain from "hate propaganda" and "any attempt to seize by force new positions."

Thousands of M23 fighters remain in eastern DRC.

DRC expected to make concessions

Though Rwanda denies backing the group, in June, Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe agreed to lift what he called "defensive measures" in east DRC once Congo disbands an armed group Rwanda says was behind the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

Analysts, however, say the withdrawal of M23 rebels from the cities of Bakayu and Goma — which they recently took control of — will depend largely on what concessions the DRC is ultimately willing to make.

The deal signed in Washington was accompanied by a side agreement that President Donald Trump said would provide the US access to the DRC's vast mineral wealth.

The UN has called the conflict in eastern DRC, which has displaced more than seven million people, "one of the most protracted, complex and serious humanitarian crises on earth."

Secretary Marco Rubio hosts a Democratic Republic of the Congo-Rwanda Peace Agreement signing ceremony between Democratic Republic of the Congo Foreign Minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner and Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe at the Department of State in Washington, D.C., June 27, 2025.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda plan to sign a landmark truce agreement in Washington on Friday, marking a potential turning point after decades of conflict in eastern Congo. The US-brokered deal aims to halt hostilities and pave the way for deeper economic cooperation between the two neighbours.

Sources close to the talks said the agreement, due to be signed by the Rwandan and Congolese foreign ministers, covers the two main pillars of security and economic cooperation.

This is the most ambitious plan yet to end an ongoing crisis that has killed millions and forced many more from their homes.

At the heart of the deal lies a pledge by Kinshasa and Kigali to cease all hostilities - direct or indirect - and to resolve disputes through peaceful means.

Both sides also commit to ending support for armed groups, with particular reference to the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) and the March 23 Movement (AFC/M23).

The deal builds on an earlier agreement signed in Luanda in October 2024. It sets out steps to find and disarm FDLR fighters. Options include voluntary returns or joint operations by Congolese and Rwandan troops.

While the AFC/M23 is not included in the main text, officials emphasise that its fate will be handled through a parallel political dialogue already under way in Doha, Qatar.

A joint monitoring team with members from the DRC, Rwanda and the mediators will track whether both sides stick to the deal.

Economic integration and US interests

On top of the security plan, the draft deal lays out a three-part economic strategy to help stabilise the region and tie it closer to US interests.

First, it calls for more cooperation between Kinshasa and Kigali on hydro power, national parks and the legal trade of minerals. The aim is to build clear supply chains "from the mine to the refined metal".

Second, the deal pushes for stronger regional links through groups like the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region, the East African Community and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa.

These bodies should help boost trade, draw in investors and stop smuggling. Audits will check that things stay transparent.

Third, the United States is expected to step up its role to secure access to critical minerals for green and tech industries. This includes resources not just in North Kivu and South Kivu but also other provinces.

'Fundamentally an economic war'

Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi welcomed the American role in an interview this week and praised the involvement of President Donald Trump..

"There's nothing magical about this agreement," Tshisekedi said. "It is the result of a realisation within the American administration about a conflict that has lasted for nearly 30 years and caused millions of deaths."

He underscored the dual nature of the conflict: "First, we must end the war and obtain the unconditional withdrawal of armed groups. But beyond that, this is fundamentally an economic war."

Tshisekedi also acknowledged Trump's direct role, including the appointment of Dr Massad Boulos as lead envoy and the backing of both Qatar and the African Union.

Fragile steps forward

Despite the hopeful tone, Professor Tshibangu Kalala, an expert in international law at the University of Kinshasa, doubts Rwanda's commitment.

"Rwanda does not respect its own signature," he said, recalling a failed 2004 agreement. "Today, Rwanda is doing exactly the opposite of its commitments from 2004."

He further criticised the agreement's failure to address justice for past atrocities, pointing to the unresolved issue of reparations for victims of Rwandan military operations in Kisangani and other parts of eastern DRC.

"A peace agreement is being sought. But we are not talking about massacres, about the destruction of human lives, of material goods caused by Rwanda," he told RFI.

"Do these victims have the right to reparation, to compensation or not? We are not talking about it. There is no peace without justice."

Political analyst Christian Moleka said US involvement gives the deal more weight.

"The particularity is the involvement of the United States and its capacity to impose this roundtable, which African solutions couldn't achieve," he said.

He pointed to the diplomatic and economic clout of the US and Qatar, which succeeded where African-led talks failed.

"Previous solutions did not emphasise the economic elements. We know that the US is interested in securing the supply of critical materials and so this economic interest dimension gives weight to American diplomacy," he said.

Human rights group, Amnesty International, has accused the M23 rebels fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) of possible war crimes.

In a report published on Tuesday, it claimed the Rwanda-back militants were responsible for killing, torturing, and forcibly disappearing civilian detainees in areas under its control.

The NGO said these serious abuses violate international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes.

The decades-long conflict in the eastern Congo escalated in January, when the M23 rebels began a rapid advance.

They seized swathes of territory in the region, including the strategic city of Goma in North Kivu province, followed by Bukavu in February.

Amnesty says that earlier this year, it interviewed 18 former detainees in the two cities, 9 of whom had been tortured by M23 fighters.

The civilians said they were accused of supporting the Congolese army or government, but that the rebels provided no proof. Some were not told why they were being held.

Eight detainees said that they witnessed fellow detainees die in detention, likely from torture and harsh detention conditions.

They said hundreds were held in overcrowded, unsanitary cells without sufficient food, water, sanitation facilities or healthcare.

Most were held incommunicado and denied access to their families and to lawyers.

Amnesty is calling on the M23 to immediately release arbitrarily detained civilians, and said the rebel group should treat prisoners humanely and provide them with access to lawyers and their families.

Hundreds of civilians have been killed in clashes between M23 rebels and the Armed Forces in Goma. The fighting has driven more than 1.7 million people from their homes in North Kivu.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern DRC, in a conflict that has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises.

Despite Congo’s army and M23 having agreed to work toward a truce last month, fighting between the two sides continues.

Congo's Senate has been asked to revoke the former president's immunity from prosecution to face charges of supporting an insurgency in the east.

The Democratic Republic of Congo has initiated a bid to have the country's former President Joseph Kabila stripped of immunity from prosecution.

Kinshasa alleges that there is evidence Kabila has been supporting the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels who seized the strategic city of Goma in the east and then Bukavu, which they took in February.

Why is Congo's taking action?

Congo's Justice Minister Constant Mutamba said on Wednesday the Senate had received a request from the military's attorney general to revoke the prosecutorial immunity that Kabila enjoys as a senator for life.

Mutamba said Congo has gathered clear evidence of "war crimes, crimes against humanity and massacres of peaceful civilians and military personnel."

Mutamba added that Kabila should return to Congo to face justice or risk being tried in absentia.

Kabila went into self-imposed exile in South Africa in 2023, following a fallout between himself and President Felix Tshisekedi.

Last year, Tshisekedi accused Kabila of supporting the M23 rebels and "preparing an insurrection" in the eastern DRC, claims Kabila denies.

Conflict in eastern DRC

Conflict in the mineral-rich east claimed some 3,000 lives and exacerbated one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, with millions of people displaced.

Earlier this month Congo's military and M23 agreed to work towards a truce but reports indicate that fighting has continued in the eastern province of South Kivu.

Kabila came to power in 2001 after the assassination of his father Laurent Kabila. He refused to stand down when his final term officially ended in 2016, leading to deadly protests, before finally agreeing to leave office following an election in 2018.

Displaced people reaching Tawila locality. They mainly come from El Fasher and surrounding camps like Zamzam and Abu Shok and report extreme violence, repeated shelling, skyrocketing commodity prices and food shortages as the main reasons to move.

Following the Rapid Support Forces’ (RSF) large-scale ground offensive on Zamzam camp that started on 11 April, hundreds of thousands of people have joined the communities already besieged and deprived of lifesaving aid in El Fasher, the neighbouring capital city of North Darfur. 25,000 more reached Tawila further west, where overwhelmed MSF teams are currently expanding activities to cope with the most pressing medical needs. We are making an urgent appeal to put an end to the siege and the atrocities, to deliver humanitarian aid, including by airdropping food and medicines to El Fasher if necessary, and to allow those who wish to flee to do so safely.

The RSF and their allied armed groups stormed Zamzam, Sudan’s largest displacement camp, which used to host at least 500,000 people near El Fasher, after months of an increasingly tight siege on the area. By 16 April, the camp, by then largely destroyed, was reportedly under RSF control. The majority of the Zamzam population is believed to have fled to El Fasher, where they remain trapped, out of reach of humanitarian aid and exposed to ongoing attacks and further mass violence.

While MSF in Tawila saw over 25,000 people arriving from Zamzam and nearby areas between 12 and 15 April, displaced people are now arriving more sporadically and at great risk for their lives along the way. Our teams set up a health post at the entrance of Tawila to provide the new arrivals with water and immediate nutritional and medical support. We refer critical cases to the local hospital where we have been working since last October. About 1,600 patients so far have required emergency outpatient services, mainly because of severe dehydration.

“We are treating children who were literally dying of thirst on their journeys. We have received so far over 170 people with gunshot and blast injuries and 40 per cent of them are women and girls”, said Marion Ramstein, MSF project coordinator in Tawila. "People tell us that many injured and vulnerable people could not make the trip to Tawila and were left behind. Almost everyone we talk to said they lost at least one family member during the attack”.

Horrific reports emerge from Zamzam camp, where hundreds of people are estimated to have been killed. Fighters were said to be going door-to-door, shooting people hiding in their homes and burning large parts of the camp. Casualties include eleven staff from the humanitarian organisation Relief International, which was running the only remaining clinic in the camp after MSF suspended all its activities in Zamzam in February due to escalating violence and blockades.

We urge the Rapid Support Forces and all armed groups in the area to spare and protect civilians and ensure that those who want to flee can do so without further harm. States and diplomatic actors must use their leverage to translate hollow statements into concrete actions. There have been repeated warnings from the UN and many observers about the risks of mass killings and ethnic violence in El Fasher and the surroundings displacement camps, mostly inhabited by people from the non-Arab Zaghawa and Fur ethnic groups, while most of the RSF fighters and their allies originate from Arab tribes.

After two years of a catastrophic war on people met by neglectful indifference, it remains inconceivable to simply resign ourselves to the current collective failure to provide vital assistance where it’s most needed.

“A massive humanitarian response is needed, now more urgently than ever. If the roads to El Fasher are blocked, then air operations must be launched to bring food and medicines to the estimated one million people trapped there and being starved. A scaled-up response is also needed in Tawila, where some of the survivors are being received and local capacities are overwhelmed”, said Rasmane Kabore, MSF Head of mission in Sudan.

MSF and several other actors are launching emergency interventions in Tawila, but much more is needed in terms of water, food, medical care and shelter.

Nations Pledge Continued Dialogue for Peace in DR Congo

Representatives from the United States, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), France, Qatar, Rwanda, and Togo convened in Doha to reaffirm their commitment to peace, stability, and economic development in the Great Lakes region.

The discussion centered on the humanitarian crisis in eastern DRC, the ongoing dialogue between the DRC government and the AFC/M23 movement, which continues to demand an urgent and coordinated response. The representatives welcomed recent progress and emphasized the need for addressing the root causes of the crisis through sustained dialogue.

This comes after DRC and Rwandan-backed M23 rebels agreed to a ceasefire in eastern DR Congo until peace talks mediated by Qatar reached their conclusion. This marked the latest truce since the rebels launched a major offensive in January, during which approximately 7,000 people were reported killed.

Congolese authorities said Saturday they had suspended the party of former President Joseph Kabila.

An Interior ministry statement justifying the ban on the People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy (PPRD) accused Kabila of of 'overt' activism.

It said the 53-year-old had been reluctant to condemn M23, the rebel group controlling North and South KIvu provinces.

Kinshasa has accused Kabila, in self-imposed exile since 2023 until Friday, of supporting separatist armed rebellion in the country's east.

Kabila who ruled Congo until 2019 made a low key return to the country Friday.

He arrived in the rebel-held city of Goma through Rwanda.

Weeks before his return, Kabila said he wanted to make a contribution to peace in Congo without elaborating how.

Days ago, Congolese security forces raided two properties belonging to Kabila - a farm east of Kinshasa and a compound in the capital. The raids were confirmed by the Kabila family spokesperson.

There has been no word from the party on its suspension.

Separately, the justice ministry said that a prosecutor had started legal action against Kabila for his ties with M23, the rebel group that Kinshasa says is backed by Rwanda.

As violence continues to escalate in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), families returning to their communities after months—or even years—of displacement are met with ruin, hunger, and uncertainty.

“These are families that were already displaced before the crisis that has rocked the city of Goma and North Kivu more broadly,” says Hercules Kipa, Head of Emergency Programmes for Concern, speaking from Kibumba. “Following this latest crisis, these communities returned to their areas of origin. These families that are returning home don’t have land to cultivate and have lost their sources of income. They are home, but their humanitarian needs continue.”

The most recent wave of displacement, triggered by renewed violence and the dismantling of internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, has forced over a million people into precarious conditions. Humanitarian actors are on the ground, but their operations are hampered by serious funding shortfalls and a lack of security guarantees.

Beneficiaries like Mediatrice Busogi, who recently returned to Kibumba, share harrowing stories of survival and resilience. “When we returned, we found many dilapidated houses. The luckiest found their houses without doors and without roofs,” she explains. “We used tarpaulins to cover the houses and crammed into them with other families and that's how we live so far.”

Despite the urge to rebuild, the road ahead is uncertain. For many, returning home is only the beginning of another struggle. In Sake, another hotspot in North Kivu, displaced community representative Byamungu Rukera outlines the priorities: “If we are lucky enough to return to our village, we will need to rehabilitate or rebuild our houses, have food, [and] household items until we can harvest the produce from our fields.”

Thousands of children have been subjected to rape and sexual violence in conflict-battered eastern Congo over the course of two months, the U.N. children's agency said Friday, warning that existing funding gaps meant that hundreds of thousands were deprived of protection.

Children make up between 35% to 45% of the nearly 10,000 cases of rape and sexual violence reported January and February this year, James Elder, the spokesperson for UNICEF told reporters in Geneva on Friday.

“In short, based on initial data (...) a child was raped every half an hour," Elder said.

He added that UNICEF faced significant funding gaps, which threatened care for hundreds of thousands children.

“If UNICEF is unable to fill the funding gap left after programs were terminated for key humanitarian services, 250,000 children will miss out on vital services for gender-based violence and protection in armed conflict.” he added. “We have 12 weeks.”

The decades-long conflict in the central African nation of Congo escalated in January, when the M23 rebels advanced and seized the strategic eastern Congolese city of Goma, followed by the town of Bukavu in February. The fighting has killed some 3,000 people and raised the fears of a wider regional war.

Sexual violence in Congo is used as “a weapon of war and a deliberate tactic of terror,” Elder said on Thursday. “We are not talking about isolated incidents; we are talking about a systemic crisis."

The warning came as Congo’s government and Rwanda-backed rebels were meeting i n the Gulf Arab state of Qatar for much-anticipated talks in a renewed push for peace in the conflict-battered eastern Congo, where the insurgents have seized vast territory.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced.

The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) to the east.

At least 33 deaths have been recorded after flooding and erosion caused by torrential rains in Kinshasa, reports Radio Okapi. The death toll, however, remains provisional.

Mont-Ngafula, Ngaliema, Barumbu, Limete, Matete, and Masina are reported to be the worst-affected municipalities.

"A crisis management unit has been set up under the supervision of the Ministry of the Interior. It has decided to immediately implement an evacuation plan and mobilize intervention teams to provide preliminary assistance, including the provision of temporary shelters," the government statement said in response.

Interior Minister Jacquemain Shabani called the army, the General Directorate of Migration, the Waterways Authority, and the General Directorate of Customs and Excise to ensure the transportation of people living in the submerged areas to identified reception sites.

Four reception sites are being prepared:

The Lumumba Institute, where 115 families are supported,

Kitomesa in Ndjili, with 100 families supported,

Kimwenza, which accommodates 70 families,

The Tata Raphaël stadium, already operational.

The army deployed vehicles to transport people stranded for 24 hours on Lumumba Boulevard, between Matete Bridge and District 1.

More than 30 people have died in flooding in Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, after torrential rains over the weekend.

On Monday, the authorities raced to evacuate and support hundreds of people trapped in their homes.

The Ndjili River, which cuts through the city of around 17 million people, overflowed its banks on Friday night, submerging hundreds of buildings.

Officials said most of the fatalities were caused by walls that collapsed shortly after the deluge began.

While the situation had improved by Monday morning, some access roads remained blocked and traffic was limited.

Many residents blamed the government for not responding quickly enough to the disaster.

“I was born, grew up, and had my children here in Congo. I have never encountered these kinds of situations,” said François Munday. “The country is not working.”

The government has set up at least four emergency shelters for hundreds of displaced families, and many across the city are without water after infrastructure was damaged

Françoise Mutela sells bananas and okra in the city, and was stopped on her way to her usual spot by the floodwaters.

“I have never seen something like this before,” she said.

With many having lost everything, and homes, buildings, and infrastructure damaged or destroyed, it is unclear how long it will take the city to recover.

The disaster comes at a difficult time for the DRC which is battling M23 rebels in the east of the country, intensifying a humanitarian crisis there.

The capital struggles as the Ndjili River overflows, leaving drivers stranded, and infrastructure collapses.

Heavy rains have triggered severe flooding from a key river in the Democratic Republic of the Congo capital Kinshasa, killing some 30 people and destroying homes and roads.

Provincial Health Minister Patricien Gongo provided the death toll on Sunday but stressed it was “provisional”. Most of the fatalities in the deluge, he added, were caused by collapsing walls.

The Ndjili River, which cuts through the teeming city of nearly 17 million people, burst its banks on Friday night, submerging the main national road. Motorists were left stranded for hours, with some spending the entire night in their cars.

“On the way home from the airport last night to welcome a friend, we spent the night in the car because there was no safe place to park,” Patricia Mikonga, a Kinshasa resident, told Reuters news agency.

Many neighbourhoods were plunged into darkness, while others suffered water shortages.

Kinshasa Governor Daniel Bumba Lubaki said water infrastructure had been damaged but assured residents that supply would be restored within days. Speaking on state television, he blamed illegal housing for some of the deaths and warned that people living in unplanned settlements could face eviction.

Raphael Tshimanga Muamba, a hydrologist, said human activity had worsened the river’s condition over time.

“These are anthropogenic actions where rivers are degraded; their dimensions no longer represent their initial capacity to contain floods,” he told Reuters.

The flooding comes as the country faces mounting instability with conflict in the eastern part of the country. Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have ramped up attacks there since the start of the year, with more than 7,000 people killed and millions displaced in recent months.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has issued a warning about the persistent violence in North and South Kivu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which continues to result in civilian deaths, injuries, and displacement.

The ongoing conflict between local armed groups and M23 rebels continues to result in loss of life, injuries, and displacement among the local population.

Meanwhile, the southern province of Tanganyika is grappling with a rapidly escalating cholera outbreak that poses a serious threat to thousands.

Intense clashes between local armed groups and M23 rebels were reported on Thursday in the town of Masisi Centre in North Kivu.

As of Wednesday, nine out of the eleven health zones in the province have been affected, with over 1,450 confirmed cases and 27 deaths reported since January—a shocking six-fold increase compared to the same period last year.

UN health partners emphasize the urgent need for access to safe drinking water, noting that less than 20 percent of the affected areas have adequate coverage, coupled with insufficient healthcare resources to effectively address the growing number of cases.

Could the Democratic Republic of Congo be forced to face even more instability soon?

Thomas Lubanga, a war criminal convicted by the International Criminal Court, recently announced the formation of the Convention for the Popular Revolution (CPR) movement in eastern Congo's Ituri province.

The announcement comes as Congolese armed forces have been struggling for months to fight off a rapid advance from another rebel group, the Rwandan-backed M23 movement, into North and South Kivu.

A historical precedent

It is not the first time that Lubanga would be at the helm of a rebel movement. In the early 2000s, he founded the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) movement, a political and military group involved in the Ituri conflict.

In 2012, Lubanga was convicted to 14 years in prison for recruiting child soldiers, but was released in 2020.

He is currently based in neighbouring Uganda.

According to Reuters, Lubanga said that the CPR was both a political and an armed movement and that bringing peace to Ituri province required "an immediate change of government".

He however claimed that the group has for now not launched any military operations.

It is furthermore unclear how many combatants Lubanga might control.

Rwanda-backed M23 rebels entered the strategic town of Walikale in eastern Congo late Wednesday, according to residents and civil society leaders, a day after the Congolese and Rwandan presidents called for an immediate ceasefire.

“The information is confirmed: the rebels are visible at the monument and at the Bakusu group office," Prince Kihangi, a former provincial deputy elected for the Walikale territory, told The Associated Press over the phone, referring to locations in the centre of Walikale. "This confirms the presence of the M23 in the territorial capital."

By taking control of Walikale, the M23 rebels seized a road linking four provinces in the east of the country: North Kivu, South Kivu, Tshopo and Maniema, cutting off the Congolese army's positions.

Heavy artillery fire could be heard throughout the day but ceased in the evening, giving way to sporadic gunfire, Fiston Misona, a civil society activist in Walikale, told the AP over the phone.

“Our Congolese army is no longer fighting,” he said. “It’s as if we were being sacrificed.”

There was no immediate comment from the M23 or the Congolese government.

The escalation in fighting comes a day after the presidents of Congo and Rwanda held unexpected talks in Qatar and called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.

The meeting followed a failed attempt to bring Congo’s government and M23 leaders together for ceasefire negotiations on Tuesday. The rebels pulled out Monday after the European Union announced sanctions on rebel leaders.

The decades-long conflict in eastern Congo escalated in January when the Rwanda-backed rebels advanced and seized the strategic city of Goma, followed by Bukavu in February.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced.

The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) to the east.

The U.N. Human Rights Council last month launched a commission to investigate atrocities, including allegations of rape and killing akin to “summary executions” by both sides.

The Walikale area is home to the largest tin deposits in Congo and to several significant gold mines. The Bisie tin mine, around 60 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of the town, accounts for most tin exports from North Kivu province. Last week, its operator Alphamin Resources said it was temporarily halting mining operations due to the rebels' advance.

Rwanda-backed M23 rebels pushed further into eastern Congo on Wednesday, advancing into the outskirts of Walikale just one day after the presidents of Congo and Rwanda called for an immediate ceasefire.

Residents reported hearing gunfire near Walikale's Nyabangi neighborhood. Some locals described the sounds of conflict, while an anonymous military source confirmed that the rebels were engaged in combat with both Congolese soldiers and pro-government militias after launching a surprise attack on an army position just outside the town.

Walikale, a town with a population of around 15,000 and located in a mineral-rich region, marks the furthest westward point the M23 rebels have reached during their rapid offensive this year.

Situated about 125 km (80 miles) northwest of Goma, Congo's largest eastern city, which fell to the rebels in January, Walikale places the M23 fighters within 400 km of Kisangani, the country’s fourth-largest city.

The attack took place even as the presidents of Congo and neighboring Rwanda met Tuesday in Qatar for their first direct talks calling for an immediate ceasefire in the restive region.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced.

Uganda's role in eastern DR Congo has largely gone under the radar during recent violence but its complex approach aims to secure long-standing security and economic interests in the mineral-rich area, experts say.

Backed by Rwanda, the M23 armed group has swept through the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, taking two regional capitals.

It is the latest escalation in an area that has long been victim of a patchwork of armed actors scrambling for dominance over the region's vast resources of coltan, gold, tin and tungsten.

Numerous countries have been drawn in over the years, including peacekeepers from southern and eastern Africa trying to support the flailing Congolese military, and Burundian forces protecting their border.

Uganda has played a particularly complex role.

In 2021, it launched Operation Shujaa, deploying troops with the DRC's consent to Ituri and North Kivu provinces -- ostensibly to clear the area of the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan militia with links to the Islamic State jihadist group.

But it has gone a step further in recent weeks, increasing its presence nearly in tandem with the M23's advances further south.

Last month, Uganda said it had "taken control" of security in the Ituri provincial capital, Bunia.

"Uganda's attitude remains ambiguous," Kristof Titeca, an East Africa expert at the University of Antwerp, told AFP.

"It is difficult to know how its attitude towards Kinshasa, Kigali and the M23 will evolve."

- 'Buffer zone' -

Uganda is primarily concerned with security but also has economic interests, experts say.

It wants "a buffer zone" to protect itself from the Islamist militia and the general chaos emanating out of eastern DRC, a diplomat specialising in the Great Lakes region told AFP on condition of anonymity.

But it also wants to ensure "a bigger market for Uganda and for Ugandan products", said Phillip Apuuli Kasaija, a politics professor at Makerere University in Kampala.

He said Uganda was making vast sums by taking Congolese gold that was then "labelled... and exported as Ugandan".

"For the last three years, Uganda's gold exports have gone through the roof," he said.

Uganda-based refiners have denied dealing in smuggled gold and the government last year tightened gold trading regulations, saying it wanted to curb smuggling.

In January, Ugandan army spokesman Felix Kulayigye openly called for more roads -- the "veins of business" -- in eastern Congo.

The border is also the site of a massive oil exploration project in Lake Albert between Uganda, the French firm TotalEnergies and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation.

Envy of Uganda's economic advances in the DRC may even have spurred Rwanda's support for the M23, with it feeling marginalised and "seeing its interests threatened", according to a research paper by groups linked to New York University last year.

- Politics is personal -

Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, in power since 1986, has spent years building a complex web of personal relationships with neighbours to project his country's status as a regional power and his own as an elder statesman.

He intervened in two Congo wars, in 1996-1997 and 1998-2003, and during last decade's civil war in South Sudan, where his army says it has again deployed special forces in recent days.

A former rebel fighter himself, Museveni's feelings towards the M23 are unclear.

In 2024, UN experts claimed Ugandan intelligence had provided "active support" to the M23, including rear operating bases on its territory.

The Great Lakes diplomat said there was "ethnic sympathy" between Museveni's Bahima community and the Tutsis who make up the majority of the M23.

There is also Museveni's "mentor-like, big-brother" relationship with Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who fought with the future Ugandan leader during the bush wars of the 1980s, the diplomat said.

Even if that relationship has proven combative over the years, Museveni's son, the unpredictable army chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, is a bombastically vocal supporter of Kagame, and has referred to the M23 as "brothers".

Although Museveni deployed troops to the DRC with the consent of President Felix Tshisekedi, the Congolese leader could hardly refuse, according to the diplomat.

And Museveni made it clear in February that Ugandan soldiers would not fight M23: "Our presence in Congo, therefore, has nothing to do with fighting the M23 rebels."

As the diplomat noted: "Tshisekedi is not fooled, he knows that the 'old man' can easily play a double game."

The three countries call for ‘immediate and unconditional ceasefire’ in eastern DRC.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame have held direct talks for the first time since Rwanda-backed M23 rebels seized two major cities in eastern DRC.

In a joint statement issued with Qatar, whose emir mediated the talks in Doha, the countries called for an “immediate ceasefire” in eastern DRC.

“The Heads of State then agreed on the need to continue the discussions initiated in Doha in order to establish solid foundations for lasting peace,” the statement said.

The DRC has accused Rwanda of sending weapons and troops to support the M23 rebels, which Rwanda has denied.

The talks came after M23 representatives pulled out of a planned meeting with the DRC government in Angola on Tuesday, after the European Union imposed sanctions on some of the group’s senior members, including leader Bertrand Bisimwa.

In a statement, M23 said the sanctions “seriously compromise direct dialogue and prevent any advance”.

The EU also sanctioned three Rwandan military commanders and the country’s mining agency chief over support for the M23 fighters.

The conflict in eastern DRC escalated in January when the rebels advanced and seized the strategic city of Goma, followed by Bukavu in February.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich eastern DRC near the border with Rwanda. The conflict has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises, with more than 7 million people displaced.

M23 rebels said they were pulling out of talks with the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo because EU sanctions against Rwandan officials earlier in the day "undermined" negotiations.

The Rwanda-backed M23 armed group said Monday that it will withdraw from peace talks set for Tuesday in Angola.

The M23 rebels had planned direct negotiations with the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo to end the conflict in the country's east.

But the Congo River Alliance of rebel groups, which includes the M23 group, said it was pulling out of talks because of sanctions imposed by the EU earlier in the day against M23 and Rwandan officials.

The rebel group coalition said in a statement that the EU actions were aimed at "obstructing the much-anticipated talks."

Rwanda also said earlier in the day that it was cutting diplomatic ties with its former colonial ruler, Belgium, with Kigali accusing Brussels of attempting to "sustain its neo-colonial delusions."

Talks to end fighting in Congo break down

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi had previously refused direct talks with the M23 rebels that have fought the government for more than a decade.

But Tshisekedi announced last week he was ready to meet with the M23 group after a meeting with his Angolan counterpart, who has acted as a mediator in the conflict.

Tina Salama, a spokesperson for Tshisekedi, said after the M23's withdrawal that the government delegation would travel to Luanda anyway.

The M23 escalated its fight earlier in the year. Despite assertions by the US and UN experts, Rwanda has denied supporting the rebels.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda.

The rebel group seized two big cities in eastern Congo since fighting escalated this year. The fighting has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands since the beginning of the year.

On one side of the lake, lovers glide on canoes, friends ride jet-skis and families pose for pictures in the hazy sunset. On the other side, less than two miles away, dead bodies washed ashore while ammunition and discarded weapons littered the water.

The shore of Lake Kivu in Rwanda offers leisure and relaxation. Across the border in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the same lake displayed devastation and misery after an armed group called M23 captured the lakeside city of Goma last month. Nearly 3,000 people were killed in the January offensive, according to the United Nations.

“It is peaceful here, unlike over there,” said Exauce Shalako, a 20-year-old man from Goma who was lounging on the shore of Lake Kivu in Rwanda one afternoon this month. Mr. Shalako, who said he had lost a friend in the fighting, had crossed into Rwanda for a day at the beach. “We need to unwind, to have a change of scene,” he said.

Around 1,300 SADC soldiers are set to leave the country as the M23, backed by Rwanda, continues its advance. Despite diplomatic sanctions, Kigali remains steadfast, defending its sovereignty.

Congolese analyst Christian Moleka warns that this situation is creating conditions for instability in the already fragile and mineral-rich eastern DRC.

"The complexity of the Congolese issue lies in the balancing act, where points are given to both Kinshasa and Kigali," Moleka explains. "This approach, however, is unfavorable to Kinshasa. While pressure and sanctions have been directed at Kinshasa, Rwanda continues to receive small concessions that balance the situation. But this strategy will not fundamentally resolve the issue; it may calm tensions in the short term, but the international community must eventually recognize who the aggressor and the victim are," said Christian Moleka, a political analyst.

The SADC's exit from the DRC is seen as a strategic failure, as Kinshasa had hoped to weaken the M23 militarily, as was done in 2013. However, the Congolese military lacks resources, and during their capture of Goma and Bukavu, the M23 managed to recruit dozens of soldiers who had fled the frontlines.

"There are significant reforms needed in the security apparatus," says Moleka. "Internal cohesion must be restored, and this will depend on the president’s ability to maneuver and use political levers to foster unity, reduce internal conflicts, and implement necessary reforms, particularly in military leadership. While there are still options, much depends on the choices made by key players," said Christian Moleka, a political analyst.

Kinshasa is also hesitant to engage in direct negotiations with the M23 under Luanda’s mediation. According to Moleka, the DRC has little choice but to enter into dialogue; at worst, the government may attempt to delay the talks by claiming the M23 is raising its demands.

"Kinshasa has little room to avoid going to Luanda," Moleka says. "International pressure is mounting for direct negotiations. We've seen this in Resolution 2773, at the African Union, and during the EAC-SADC summit, which calls for indirect talks. The M23 continues to advance in South Kivu, and there are concerns about the spread of fighting into regions like Kindu, Maniema, Tshopo Kisangani, and Katanga. This risk is also weighing heavily on Kinshasa," said Christian Moleka, a political analyst.

Meanwhile, the security and humanitarian situation remains critical in several North Kivu cities.

In response to the escalating crisis, UNHCR is urgently calling for international mobilization to prevent a full-blown humanitarian disaster. Without immediate assistance, thousands of lives are at risk.

M23 fighters, backed by Rwanda, continue to advance into eastern DR Congo. While the rebels are outnumbered by the Congolese army, DW examines whether the military has the capacity to respond effectively.

Since January, the M23 rebel movement has seized Goma and Bukavu — two key cities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) — and since set up to govern for the long term in the regions under its control.

The Congolese armed forces (FARDC) comprised around 135,000 soldiers in 2022, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, although experts believe this figure has since risen.

The United Nations estimates that M23 has only a few thousand fighters, supported by around 4,000 Rwandan soldiers.

FARDC's internal struggles

In 2023, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi more than doubled military spending to $794 million (€732 million) — which raises questions about how M23 fighters have managed togain control of such significant regions of eastern DRC.

"One of the main factors explaining the weakness of the FARDC lies in systemic corruption," suggested Alain De Neve, a researcher at the Royal Higher Institute for Defense (RHID) in Brussels, a Belgian think tank.

"Numerous reports have highlighted the disappearance of funds intended for soldiers' salaries and military logistics," De Neve added. "This practice explains why troop morale is particularly low and why desertions are recurrent. In some cases, soldiers stationed in the eastern part of the country even resort to looting or extorting local populations in order to survive."

Ciaran Wrons-Passmann, director of the German Ecumenical Network for Central Africa (ÖNZ), said the FARDC had developed a "life of its own" — becoming a "self-service shop," and providing an "opportunity for leaders to enrich themselves."

What's more, senior FARDC military officers in eastern DRC have reported commanding significantly more soldiers than they actually do, as Jakob Kerstan, head of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation's office in Kinshasa, noted.

"Because they then also receive more funding from Kinshasa," Kerstan said. "The money is mostly distributed via the generals."

Lack of training, equipment, communication

Citing soldiers' testimonies, interviews with military officers and a confidential UN memo, the news agency Reuters has described FARDC as "a fighting force hobbled by entrenched problems such as poor pay and corruption that reform efforts have failed to resolve."

Although Tshisekedi announced improved pay for soldiers as part of military reforms, Kerstan pointed out that these wages paled in comparison to those of Eastern European mercenaries, who "were paid tens of thousands of euros per month."

So, "you work with other players who you think are better suited. That undermines the esprit de corps," explained Wrons-Passmann.

According to De Neve, another major issue for the FARDC is the "chronic deficit in training and equipment — unlike M23, which benefits from structured training and combat tactics well-adapted to the mountainous terrain of North Kivu."

In contrast, the FARDC is highly outdated and inefficient in terms of technology and logistics, Kerstan pointed out.

"Kinshasa sometimes doesn't know where parts of the army are traveling in eastern Congo," he said. "The army is sometimes coordinated via Whatsapp, which makes it extremely difficult for Kinshasa to give clear instructions that are then implemented on the ground."

Cronyism and the fear of a coup

The government shows an "unwillingness to delegate real military power to competent officers," said De Neve, who pointed out that cronyism is widespread.

"Military commanders are not always selected based on their competence, but rather according to their loyalty to the regime. This leads to poor tactical and operational decisions."

The DR Congo appears to struggle with recruiting loyal military officers.

"There has been a lot of rotation in the chiefs of staff and also in the intelligence services," said Wrons-Passmann. "This shows that [Tshisekedi] has not found the right personnel to implement his ideas, if he has any."

"Instead of being reformed into a professional force, the national army has absorbed former warlords, but also their own networks of loyalty," De Neve added. "This phenomenon has led to the existence of parallel chains of command."

Army's legacy of division

Even the late former president Mobutu Sese Seko "did not want the army to become too strong, for fear of a coup d'état, and played generals off against each other," Kerstan explained.

"In principle, the army was never there to take over national defense," said Wrons-Passmann. "Even under Mobutu, priority was given to the presidential guard."

Under Mobutu's successors, Laurent and Joseph Kabila, the army was infiltrated by Rwanda, among other nations.

"That is also the reason why the government is now so reluctant to negotiate with M23," said Jakob Kerstan. "Because they are afraid that they will be infiltrated."

"Don't forget that this army was led at the beginning, after the fall of Mobutu, by James Kabarebe, a Rwandan military officer who is now under sanctions from the United States," Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya told DW.

"After the Sun City Agreement (…) we mixed all those [from the] military coming from the Rwandan side. When you mix all this, it becomes something very complicated."

Crucial influence of Rwanda's army

The army had been "betrayed from within," Tshisekedi told his supporters. "My predecessor spent 18 years in power without rebuilding the army," the president told the US daily The New York Times. Some members of the armed forces lacked a "sense of duty" to the nation, Tshisekedi's office said.

"One of the key elements explaining the FARDC's difficulty in defeating M23 lies in the military support from Rwanda," said De Neve.

Additionally, Rwanda's army is "extremely well organized," as Wrons-Passmann noted.

The DRC is now working on reforming its armed forces, said Muyaya — but it's not happening quickly.

"You cannot think that you can solve, finish all the reform […] for the army in five years," he added. "We started doing that. Why do you think President Kagame decided to attack and [wage] this war in the DRC? Because he's witnessing the way things are changing."

The Southern African Development Community announced Thursday it will withdraw its peacekeeping force from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, as the M23 armed group signaled cautious approval for Angola-brokered talks to resolve the escalating conflict.

The Rwanda-backed M23 armed group cautiously welcomed Thursday the prospect of direct negotiations with the Congolese government to end the conflict in the volatile eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

Since its 2021 resurgence the M23 has been fighting the Congolese army there, seizing swathes of the DRC's mineral-rich territory in a region plagued by decades of violence.

In recent months its rapid advance has sparked fears of a wider war drawing in regional powers, while the deaths of peacekeepers from southern Africa prompted a regional bloc to decide to pull its mission to the DRC on Thursday.

On Tuesday, Angola said it would host talks in a bid to halt the fighting, later giving a date of March 18 for the beginning of negotiations.

In a statement the M23 said it "welcomed favourably" the announcement of the talks, to be held in the Angolan capital Luanda.

The armed group nonetheless raised several "concerns", urging Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi to "publicly and unequivocally express his commitment to direct negotiations" as an "absolute necessity".

Tshisekedi had previously refused to engage in direct dialogue with the M23, which he has repeatedly branded a "terrorist" group.

But Angolan President Joao Lourenco had said Tuesday that "direct negotiations" between the two sides would take place, after receiving Tshisekedi for discussions.

Tshisekedi's spokesperson, Tina Salama, said on X that his government took "note" of Angola's efforts but would not be drawn on the specifics.

Various rounds of talks between the DRC and Rwanda have produced a series of ceasefires and truces that have had little effect on the fighting, which has displaced tens of thousands and triggered a vast humanitarian crisis.

Both Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame have been negotiation no-shows on previous occasions. Tshisekedi is yet to comment on the Angolan proposal himself.

A summit between the two leaders announced by Luanda in December foundered after the DRC refused Kigali's request to negotiate with the M23 directly.

- Southern African pullout -

In recent months the M23 launched a lightning offensive that has pushed the Congolese army out much of the eastern North and South Kivu provinces, with Rwanda's help.

It is the latest flare-up in a region devastated by decades of fighting involving dozens of armed groups, with many seeking to control its rich veins of key minerals used in technology.

Since January the armed group has taken the key provincial capitals of Goma and Bukavu straddling the Rwandan border, and readied itself to govern for the long term in the territory it has captured.

On Thursday, the 16-nation Southern African Development Community (SADC) said it had decided to end its military deployment to the eastern DRC, following the deaths of more than a dozen of its soldiers during the M23 offensive.

Made up of soldiers from Malawi, Tanzania and South Africa, the peacekeeping force was sent to the eastern DRC in December 2023 to help the Congolese government restore order.

Rwanda, which unlike the DRC is not a member of the SADC, accused the peacekeeping mission of being an offensive force that added to the eastern DRC's existing problems.

Speaking to the press, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa Thursday said he hoped the SADC withdrawal would "consolidate" efforts towards a truce, adding the prospect of the start of negotiations built confidence that peace was possible.

Since the beginning of this year the M23's offensive has killed more than 7,000 people, according to the DRC. AFP has not been able to verify that figure independently.

Rwanda denies providing the M23 with military support.

But a UN experts' report found Kigali maintains around 4,000 troops in the DRC's east to assist the armed group.

Rwanda also maintains de facto control over the armed group in order to exploit the eastern DRC's rich veins of valuable minerals such as gold and coltan, according to the report.

Coltan is used in the manufacture of key electronics including laptops and mobile phones.

Rwanda has pointed to the presence in the eastern DRC of militants from the FDLR, a group founded by Hutu leaders involved in the 1994 Rwandan genocide of the Tutsis, to justify its backing of the M23.

Southern African forces to leave DR Congo as rebels gain ground

Southern African leaders have announced they will pull their troops out of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where they have been helping the government fight rebel forces. The troops were sent two years ago to support the Congolese army fight the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels, which has seized control of large parts of mineral-rich eastern DR Congo this year. At least 19 soldiers from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania were killed when the M23 captured the region's biggest city, Goma, in January. Thousands of people have been killed during the fighting and hundreds of thousands left without shelter after fleeing their homes.

There have been concerns the fighting could escalate to a wider regional conflict. The M23 has continued to gain ground in eastern DR Congo and last month seized the region's second-biggest city, Bukavu. South Africa's deployment was heavily criticised by the public and opposition following the killing of its soldiers. Announcing the withdrawal, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the "situation is precarious, but the peace as it is now is holding". However, the M23 has continued to seize more territory this week. Sandile Swanda, a South African political analyst, told the BBC it was an "embarrassing" situation for her country. "The rebels are very strong. This is a full-on war and South Africa is hardly ready for any such war," he said. He added: "No country in the Sadc region is ready for this war - psychologically, militarily and politically." But the withdrawal is not just a setback for South Africa, it's a blow to both Sadc and the DR Congo, analysts say. Stephanie Wolters, a senior research fellow at the South African Institute of International Affairs, told the BBC that Sadc's withdrawal weakens Kinshasa's position. "They [Sadc] have gone from being on Kinshasa's side to being at best in a neutral position," she said. In February, Malawi's president said its troops would be withdrawn from DR Congo, although he didn't give a reason.

The decision to start a "phased withdrawal" from DR Congo was made during a virtual summit of the 16-member Southern African Development Community (Sadc) in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, on Thursday. No reason was given. The Sadc leaders said that even though the troops would be withdrawn from DR Congo, the bloc would continue to "support interventions aimed at bringing lasting peace". Sadc also called for a diplomatic and political solution to the conflict. Previous efforts to bring peace to DR Congo have not been successful. But Angola has announced this week that it will host peace talks between DR Congo and the M23 next week in the capital, Luanda. The M23 said they "welcomed" this move. DR Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi has previously refused to engage in direct negotiations with the group, insisting on only talking to Rwanda. This was Sadc's third emergency summit on DR Congo in recent months. It is unclear how many Sadc troops are in DR Congo, but 5,000 troops were due to be sent. South Africa, which leads the mission, was to deploy 2,900 troops and the rest shared between Malawi and Tanzania.

MITI MURHESA, Congo (AP) — Hospitals across eastern Congo that were once at the forefront of the country’s response to the mpox outbreak are facing a setback in detecting the disease and offering treatment following the advance of Rwanda-backed rebels in the region.

The mpox global health emergency is worsening as the fighting between the M23 rebel group and Congolese troops escalates in eastern Congo, which has been the epicenter of the health crisis. Many patients have fled and can’t be found. Recently arrived vaccines are running short as supplies can’t reach combat zones. Hospitals have been under attack.

The Associated Press visited one of the mpox hot spots, which is now under control of M23 rebels backed by neighboring Rwanda. Health workers and remaining patients described a growing disaster.

“The situation has been very difficult. Insecurity has disrupted everything,” said Dr. Serge Munyahu Cikuru, medical officer in charge of the Miti Murhesa health zone in South Kivu province’s Kabare territory.

The country, meanwhile, continues to battle other diseases in the east, including cholera and measles, in addition to mysterious outbreaks that recently started in the northwestern region.

Cases are not being reported as before

Congo saw a 31% weekly increase in mpox cases last week, bringing the total to 16,255, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

However, that is only one side of the story: Only seven out of the 26 provinces reported cases last week, the public health agency said at its last briefing, partly blaming the security crisis.

Although Congo has seen a surge in the current vaccination phase as compared to the previous one, much of that success is in other regions while eastern Congo remains cut off.

The Miti Murhesa treatment center is fast running out of supplies.

Mubake Buroko Patrick, an mpox patient at the facility, said it was difficult to get drugs in the weeks following the fighting.

“The war has complicated our access to medicines,” he said. “I’m feeling a little better, but the treatment needs to be improved.”

Africa CDC’s mpox incident manager Dr. Ngashi Ngongo told reporters last week that authorities have started negotiations for a humanitarian corridor, which would require the suspension of hostilities to allow for humanitarian access in conflict zones.

Patients are fleeing in fear

More than 600 mpox patients fled different hospitals in eastern Congo as the fighting escalated, the Africa CDC said.

Many of the fleeing patients were in the Miti Murhesa health zone, one of the hardest hit in the mpox outbreak. At least 4,700 cases were reported there as of the end of 2024, according to the zone’s chief medical officer Dr. Cikuru.

Only two of the four treatment centers in the zone are currently functional while others are among numerous health facilities affected by the fighting between government forces and M23, he said.

As M23 seized Goma and Bukavu, their fighters were expanding their presence in the region, including in other parts of North Kivu and South Kivu provinces where they had been present for years.

Many patients in Miti Murhe have had to “choose between staying under fire or fleeing” the rebels, Dr. Cikuru said.

Tracing patients to prevent spread of mpox has become more difficult and health workers are running out of options on how to make the best of remaining medical supplies, he said.

“Our fear is an increase in the number of cases due to the current situation,” the doctor said. “Patient care in the treatment centers continues, but the shortage of medicines is a major concern.”

Monrovia — More than 600 people infected with mpox left treatment centers in the Democratic Republic of Congo due to fighting in the eastern part of the country, the African Centers for Disease Control said during an online briefing on the status of the disease on March 6. The continental health body said, although more than 150 of those who ran away returned in the eastern city of Bukavu - following a relative improvement in security - they still cannot account for hundreds more.

The country is the epicenter of the latest disease outbreak in the region, which the Africa CDC declared in 2024 a "public health emergency of international concern". During the briefing, however, the head of the Incident Management Team in the DR Congo, Ngashi Ngongo, said they were witnessing a decline in the trend of confirmed cases in the country, which he attributed to insecurity that has led to "low testing".

Ngongo lauded the country's progress on vaccination against the disease, noting that more than 300,000 Congolese have so far been vaccinated in the Kinshasa area. He also reported a significant drop in the number of mpox infections amongst healthcare workers - by more than 50% - which he said is as a result of increased training and new prevention mechanisms.

There have been more than 24,000 cases of mpox "notified" continent-wide in 2025 with about 6,000 having being confirmed for the disease. Angola reported two new cases of mpox after more than 8 weeks of no confirmed case in the country. 15 of the 22 countries with mpox still have "active cases" of the disease. In the eighth week of reporting in 2025, more than 600 cases were confirmed from across the 11 countries that "notified".

The Africa CDC official expressed concern that several new cases of Ebola were confirmed in Uganda, after about three weeks of no cases reported in the country. The Ugandan ministry of health in January announced a new outbreak of the disease there, which was later confirmed to be the Sudan species. The African health watchdog has said there was no direct epidemiological link between the new cluster with the last cluster which resulted in nine cases.

On Marburg, Tanzania is still counting down to declaring that outbreak over, with no new cases reported, the Africa CDC said.

The town of Kabare, located in South Kivu province, is currently grappling with a severe outbreak of Mpox, a disease primarily transmitted through close skin-to-skin contact. As the situation unfolds, healthcare workers continue to provide treatment despite the overwhelming challenges posed by ongoing conflict in the region.

The war in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which has raged since the beginning of the year, has created a dire situation for both the population and the healthcare system. Medical staff are struggling to meet the rising demand for care, with limited resources and constant disruptions. However, they remain dedicated to providing critical support to those affected by the disease.

Patrick Buroko, a local Mpox patient, shared his experience of the impact of both the war and the disease. "We suffer because of the war. The medicine is not always available. The wounds don't heal, and the body doesn't recover because the medicine comes late. But now I feel better since I received the medication. The care I’ve received has helped, but there’s still room for improvement," Buroko said. He explained that he initially fell ill with malaria, but only three days ago, he began showing symptoms of Mpox.

The Mpox virus leaves visible skin lesions and spreads primarily through skin contact, contributing to the swift spread in affected areas. Although there is no consolidated data on infection rates and fatalities, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported late last year that South Kivu was the hardest-hit province in the country.

The situation has worsened for many families. Christine Masumbuko, a mother of a young girl suffering from Mpox, recounted her daughter’s experience at the health centre. "When I brought my daughter to the health centre, her temperature was 39.5°C. They gave her some tablets, but when the nurses injected the medicine, she fainted. I thank God because her condition improved, and she's not like that anymore," she said.

The ongoing war has disrupted the region's healthcare infrastructure, with an increasing number of patients fleeing conflict zones and contributing to the spread of Mpox. Dr. Serge Cikuro, a medical officer in Miti Murhesa, highlighted the strain on the health system: "Patients continue to arrive, so we continue to provide care, but the health zone, which used to have four treatment centres, now only has two—one in Lwiro and the referral hospital in Miti."

In response to the worsening epidemic, the DRC government has launched a large-scale vaccination campaign to curb the spread of Mpox. The campaign, which began in Kinshasa on Thursday, aims to vaccinate more than 600,000 people as part of efforts to contain the outbreak.

As the country faces the dual crisis of war and disease, healthcare workers remain on the frontlines, providing essential care while navigating the ongoing challenges of conflict and limited resources.

With three neighbouring armies already on the ground, a conflict that has simmered in Democratic Republic of Congo’s eastern borderlands for years is evolving into a wider regional war.

M23 rebels, in the latest of a string of uprisings backed by Rwanda, seized the city of Goma in January and went on to make gains across North Kivu and South Kivu provinces.

The region has a history of outside interference. This time, Kinshasa has sought help from Burundi, which dispatched thousands of its troops to try to defeat the rebellion. The position of Uganda, officially in Congo to help the government fight against Islamist militants, is ambiguous as the U.N. has accused it of also backing the M23, which it denies. It has sent reinforcements over the border in recent weeks.

Congo’s government said at least 7,000 people have died in the fighting since January. At least 600,000 people have been displaced by the fighting since November, according to OCHA.

Several African armies joined the fray in Congo during wars of the 1990s and early 2000s and millions of people died, mainly from hunger and disease triggered by years of conflict and foreign occupation.

More than two decades later, the mechanisms used to end such conflicts — robust U.N. peacekeeping missions and decisive actions such as sanctions and aid cuts — are frayed.

Eastern Congo is home to vast reserves of strategic minerals such as coltan, cobalt, copper and lithium, resources that are central to the world’s race to develop new technology and green energy, so the stakes are even higher.

In the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), insecurity and horrific sexual violence have left tens of thousands fleeing across borders with no sign of the exodus stopping, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Tuesday.

"Near the frontlines, sexual violence and human rights abuses remain rampant, as is the looting and destruction of civilian homes and businesses," said Patrick Eba, Deputy Director of UNHCR's Division of International Protection.

Speaking in Geneva, Mr. Eba told journalists that that North and South Kivu provinces remain unstable, with "hundreds of thousands of people on the move".

Close to 80,000 people have fled armed clashes between Congolese Government forces and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels into neighbouring countries and some 61,000 have arrived in Burundi since January, Mr. Eba stressed.

60 rape victims a day

A staggering 895 cases of rape were reported to humanitarian actors in the last two weeks of February alone, the UN refugee agency official continued - an average of more than 60 a day.

The UNHCR official highlighted other risks faced by civilians, including the dangers posed by explosive remnants of war to children and farmers trying to tend their fields. On Monday, the UN humanitarian affairs coordination office (OCHA) reported that armed men had raided at least two hospitals in North Kivu's capital Goma, abducting dozens of patients.

The fighting has also impeded humanitarian access to people on the move. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) has had to pause its aid operations in conflict-affected areas but was resuming emergency food assistance "in some parts of North Kivu" according to a post on social media platform X on Tuesday morning, aiming to reach over 210,000 people.

M23 forced evictions

Inside North and South Kivu, "significant" population movements have continued, in line with reported M23 orders issued to internally displaced people (IDPs) to leave the camps around Goma, UNHCR's Mr. Eba said.

"Today, only around 17,000 people are left residing in IDP sites, schools and churches around Goma, while an estimated 414,000 of their neighbours have been on the move for the past four weeks, encouraged by the de facto authorities to return to their villages of origin," he explained.

Given the widespread insecurity in eastern DRC, "many more" people may need to cross borders in search of safety, Mr. Eba warned.

UNHCR's position regarding returns to the area is that "Congolese nationals fleeing the conflict, as well as those who are outside the country, who originate from the areas affected by the conflict, may need refugee protection under international and regional legal frameworks," he said.

The UNHCR official emphasized the importance of "informed decision-making" for any voluntary returns to conflict-affected areas.

Exempt from funding freeze

Asked about the impact of the United States' humanitarian funding freeze on operations in the country, UNHCR spokesperson Eujin Byun confirmed that the agency had received a waiver lifting the 90-day suspension for "a few emergency countries, including DRC".

Assistance for the current crisis that was spawned by a decades-long conflict in the mineral-rich region had "always been underfunded", she said, expressing hope that UNHCR will be able to "continue to support this emergency".

There are over one million Congolese refugees across Africa, mainly in neighbouring countries. Uganda hosts more than half of that total, while Burundi has seen most new arrivals since January's flash M23 offensive. Prior to the current crisis, some 6.7 million people were internally displaced within the DRC.

Title: DR Congo: Another mystery disease outbreak

Health authorities are conducting tests in regions of DR Congo affected by a mystery disease that has killed 60 people.

Another mystery disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has emerged, resulting in at least 60 deaths, health officials say.

It follows a similar event in September 2024, referred to as "Disease X" before the World Health Organization (WHO) identified it as a cocktail of several known acute respiratory illnesses complicated by malaria and malnutrition.

These new outbreaks could have similar origins, but it will likely take time to determine exactly what the cause is.

Toxic contamination is also considered a possible cause.

What is the current situation in the DR Congo?

More than 1,000 cases have been reported across the DR Congo's Equateur province and 141 cases of a disease have been reported in Basankusu's health zone. A separate outbreak in early February consisted of 158 cases and 58 deaths.

In January, Bolamba village reported 12 cases and eight deaths.

What have initial tests shown?

Health authorities in the DR Congo and WHO experts are carrying out investigations to determine the cause of the illness and deaths.

Early lab tests ruled out Ebola and Marburg disease. Half of those tested have tested positive for malaria.

"We're not really satisfied with the sampling, so we've sent two WHO epidemiologists up there," Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson, told DW News.

"They're up there now and they're overseeing the sampling and getting them back to the laboratories in [DR Congo's capital] Kinshasa."

Further testing is being undertaken for meningitis and potential toxic contamination.

WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan, along with local health authorities, favor the latter as a cause.

"It would appear that we have some kind of poisoning event," Ryan told reporters.

Do officials know the source of the outbreak?

The cause of the disease — and whether the illnesses in different regions are connected — remains unknown.

Early reports suggested the first cases were among a group of children who may have eaten a bat, though this incident is not yet confirmed as the cause of the outbreak.

Bats are known reservoirs of viruses and other disease-causing pathogens. Global health advice recommends people steer clear of exposure to dead animals.

Although the main outbreak villages of Basankusu and Bolomba are 116 miles (186 kilometers) apart, it's unclear if the disease outbreaks share the same cause.

What are the symptoms of the mystery disease?

The WHO's latest memo says symptoms are broad, and include fever, headaches, chills, sweating, stiffness in the neck, muscular aches, joint and body pain, coughing, vomiting and diarrhea.

The broadness of these symptoms and their potential to apply to many diseases makes it impossible to pinpoint the cause without analysis of biological samples from patients.

Some health experts believe the mystery disease is likely caused by several known pathogens acting together.

That malaria has been found in one in two cases already is important information for health authorities, but the addition of further sampling and analysis by WHO officials in conjunction with local teams will help narrow the search for a cause.

"Tests are never 100% accurate, and it is likely that with increased testing, we will have a confirmed pathogen in some of those samples," said Michael Head, an epidemiologist at the University of Southampton, UK.

Could the disease spread further?

Health infrastructure in this region of the DR Congo is limited, and there are concerns that the disease could spread. As with the malaria-respiratory infections that caused the 2024 outbreak, malnutrition and other underlying conditions can increase the chances of death.

Local health authorities have been addressing Mpox and Ebola outbreaks in recent years, so Head suggests the challenges of limited infrastructure to manage new diseases can be offset by their "experience at addressing infectious disease epidemics.”

Should a previously unknown pathogen be identified as the cause, health authorities will need to increase measures to contain the spread of the disease and identify the method of transmission.

What is happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo? On 20 January, Félix Tshisekedi was sworn in for a second five-year term as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Official results showed him winning a clear victory at polls held on 20 December 2023, though turnout was low and widespread irregularities were reported. On 9 January, the Constitutional Court affirmed tallies indicating Tshisekedi had secured 73 per cent of the vote, compared to 18 per cent for Moïse Katumbi, his closest opponent. Katumbi’s support came almost entirely from the restive Katanga region, where he was formerly governor. President Tshisekedi and his allies also scored a major victory in legislative elections, which were held on the same day, though results were announced later. On 14 January, the National Electoral Commission (CENI) published provisional results indicating that his coalition had won more than 90 per cent of the seats in the National Assembly. While Tshisekedi’s margin of victory gives him a clear mandate, problems with the election will surely leave many voters, as well as those in the political opposition, feeling aggrieved. Chaos marred the polls, leaving millions of citizens without an opportunity to cast their ballots. The opposition, which contests the results, has significant anecdotal evidence of ballot stuffing and other shenanigans. But none of this evidence is likely to help the opposition, which risks being largely frozen out as the president’s coalition divides the spoils. The war with M23 insurgents in the east, which dogged Tshisekedi’s first term, was at the heart of the electoral campaign, particularly the issue of Rwandan backing for the rebels. In North Kivu, battles continued before and after the polls, although voting took place with little interference in parts of the province unaffected by the fighting. Candidate forums were a chorus of nationalist rhetoric, with Tshisekedi using the most extreme language, comparing Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame to Adolf Hitler on 8 December. He predicted Kagame would meet the same fate as that befalling Nazi Germany’s leader. At his final campaign meeting in Kinshasa on 19 December, Tshisekedi promised that, if re-elected, he would declare war on Rwanda and march on its capital – later asserting that the Congolese army, boosted by the acquisition of new weapons including armed drones, could destroy Kigali without crossing the border. In addition, Tshisekedi frequently insinuated that rivals were working for foreign powers. Informal observations by Crisis Group staff, journalists and Congolese analysts indicate that this nationalist positioning likely helped him win re-election. Did the elections go smoothly? Although they were more peaceful than past polls and calmer than many had feared, the 20 December elections suffered numerous problems. Over a million eligible voters were unable to register beforehand due to insecurity. The opposition and civil society groups had moreover warned that the CENI’s preparations were highly deficient. A particularly blatant flaw was poorly printed voter cards, many of which had become unreadable since being issued earlier in the year, despite being a legal requirement for citizens to cast a ballot. The Catholic cardinal of Kinshasa, Fridolin Ambongo, summed up the electoral process as involving “gigantic organised disorder”. On election day, according to the domestic observation mission led jointly by the Catholic and various Protestant churches, balloting was afflicted by missing voter lists and other vital paperwork, missing or broken machinery, the late opening of polling stations, and intimidation by security forces or others acting on behalf of the candidates. Crisis Group interviews with analysts in Goma, Kinshasa and Lubumbashi confirmed these reports. In one case, in Ituri province, people ransacked a polling station. The disarray, and in some places bedlam, on 20 December led the CENI to allow some stations to reopen the following day, in violation of electoral law. In fact, many stayed open on their own accord for up to six extra days.

Participation ... was the lowest in the country’s democratic history.

These troubles appeared to have a significant impact. Participation, officially at 43 per cent, was the lowest in the country’s democratic history. While there are not yet reliable data on the precise reasons, the problems detailed above could well have deprived millions of the 44 million-strong electorate of their right to vote. The CENI’s own figures for the presidential election result, published on 31 December, fail to account for ballots cast at 11,301 of the country’s 75,497 polling stations, some of which probably failed to open. The CENI offered no explanation for this gap, contributing to concerns about the tally’s credibility. On 5 January, the CENI took the dramatic step of cancelling results in two constituencies and disqualifying 82 candidates from national and local races for alleged fraud. Those concerned are accused principally of having acquired voting machines and putting them in their private residences (presumably for the purpose of producing fake results). Most of the 82 sanctioned candidates are from Tshisekedi’s political coalition, including three serving ministers and four governors, as well as senators and members of parliament. Some of the 82 alleged fraudsters, such as the governor of the city of Kinshasa, denied the allegations and decided to refer the matter to the Constitutional Court. Later, after examining an appeal, the CENI proclaimed elected a candidate who had previously appeared on the list of 82. Given that many of those sanctioned belong to the ruling coalition, the CENI’s move may, on paper, appear to further accountability. But some analysts, as well as the Catholic Church, are worried that it creates a precedent for the CENI policing its own work and may in fact represent only a fraction of the cheating that occurred. What did critics say about the polls, and will it matter? The above-referenced domestic observation mission criticised the electoral process but stopped short of calling for a rerun. The mission’s public reports detailed several failures, stating that “numerous irregularities affected the integrity of the results of all the polls in some places”. Diplomats, informed by small, short-term foreign observer missions, noted the logistical problems but generally adopted a cautious tone.

In contrast, the opposition reacted vociferously, calling for a rerun. In the days following the polls, Katumbi claimed he had won the votes counted at that point. Another leading candidate, Martin Fayulu, who stood despite blocking his party from participating in the parliamentary polls, joined another candidate, Nobel laureate Denis Mukwege, in rejecting the entire process. None of them took their grievances to the Constitutional Court, which they see as lacking independence, instead urging street protests that did not gather momentum. At present, it does not seem that the opposition has a clear strategy in the face of Tshisekedi’s steamroller triumph. The Catholic Church, having pressed the CENI, as part of the national observation mission, to come clean about its failings, also took the gloves off in a hard-hitting communiqué issued on 16 January. It pointed to the CENI’s direct responsibility for what it called an “electoral catastrophe”. The CENI replied with its own communiqué refuting the claims and pushing back against the idea of an independent enquiry. Despite progress compared to previous elections, notably that the authorities did not exclude any candidate from running prior to the vote, the December ballot left deep scars, with no consensus about the remedies. The danger is significant that Tshisekedi and his international partners, comfortable with his margin of victory as per the official results, will minimise legitimate criticism and fail to investigate the poll’s organisational problems, despite the fact that they disenfranchised swathes of the population. Should that happen, the same problems and mistakes could recur next time. Where does the outcome leave Congolese politics? The strong showing in the parliamentary polls boosted Tshisekedi, but he will have to deal with a restive governing coalition. The provisional results published on 14 January give the parties belonging to that coalition, the Union Sacrée de la Nation, nearly 450 of the 477 seats currently allocated in the National Assembly, pending the postponed vote in territories beset by insecurity. But the president’s own party, the Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social, won only 69 seats. The parties of his key allies scored well. Those of Senate President Modeste Bahati and Deputy Prime Minister Vital Kamerhe both got 35 seats – and the latter can also rely on support from other parties in the fragmented ruling bloc. Defence Minister Jean-Pierre Bemba’s party got nineteen seats. Tshisekedi’s dependence on coalition partners means he cannot simply call the shots. Forming a government will entail competition for key offices (prime minister, in particular, as well as the heads of the National Assembly and Senate), requiring complex and time-consuming negotiations. Having failed to unite behind a single candidate to challenge Tshisekedi, the opposition won just 28 seats, including eighteen for Katumbi’s Ensemble de la République. While election irregularities may have played a part in this poor performance, other reasons include the decision by two prominent opposition figures (Fayulu and Joseph Kabila) to sit out the parliamentary polls; the incumbent’s capacity to attract local leaders to his coalition; and the opposition’s failure to build grassroots party structures outside their home bases. What is the situation in Katanga? The situation in the mineral-rich former Katanga province, split into four provinces in 2018, is a worrying element of the elections’ outcome. Katumbi swept the board in the four provinces while scoring poorly elsewhere. Results in the provincial and parliamentary races in Katanga tipped in contrast toward the ruling coalition, triggering protests in various places, as it became evident that Tshisekedi’s alliance, sometimes fielding nearly unknown candidates, had nevertheless scored well. Protests turned violent (though with no loss of life) in the Katangan towns of Kipushi, Likasi and Kolwezi following the parliamentary results. Suspicions of fraud abound in this region, whose fraught dynamics Crisis Group assessed in a pre-election report.

Katangan elites are among Tshisekedi’s most prominent critics.

Katangan elites are among Tshisekedi’s most prominent critics. Aware that the area’s mining industry is vital for the government’s budget and nostalgic for their long period of power under former Presidents Laurent-Désiré and his son Joseph Kabila (together ruling from 1997 to 2018), they are resentful of their current exclusion in favour of Tshisekedi’s allies from his native Kasaï region. Furthermore, there have been regular clashes over local power between Katangans and Kasaians. The latter, whom some among the former regard as “immigrants”, are attracted to the region’s economic and employment opportunities. A worry for Tshisekedi is that Katanga becomes a hotbed of opposition calling for greater power and resources to devolve to provincial authorities. Some might even try to create momentum behind demands for secession, which have been largely rhetorical up to now. What is the situation in the war-torn east? The war in North Kivu, which pits the Congolese army, supported by numerous pro-Kinshasa armed groups, against the well-organised and equipped M23 insurgency and the Rwandan army, remains a major challenge for Tshisekedi and the country. This predominantly Tutsi insurgency, which is widely understood to be backed by Kigali, resurfaced in November 2021 after a decade of inactivity. The M23’s leaders accuse Kinshasa of having neglected commitments to demobilise and reintegrate its fighters. Rwanda’s motivations remain difficult to discern: it denies supporting the M23 but makes it known that combating the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda or FDLR (an armed group opposed to Kigali’s leadership, whose leaders participated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide) in North Kivu remains a national priority. Recently, the M23’s demands have become more political. Spearheaded since December 2023 by a new umbrella organisation, the Alliance du Fleuve Congo (AFC) – whose emergence is discussed further below – it now explicitly aims to overthrow the national authorities, even if such an aim appears a rather distant prospect at present. The risk of direct escalating clashes between Rwandan and Congolese regular forces was underlined again on 16 January, when the Rwandan army shot dead a Congolese soldier in Rwanda’s Rubavu district and arrested two of his companions. According to the Congolese high command, the troops had inadvertently crossed the border into Rwanda.

The M23 refused to allow the CENI to register voters in areas it controlled.

The elections have hardly helped the situation. The M23 refused to allow the CENI to register voters in areas it controlled – ie, most of North Kivu – meaning that more than a million people could not participate in choosing their national and provincial representatives. Others could not cast ballots, as they were displaced by the fighting, which continued before and after the vote despite a U.S.-negotiated truce between the army and the M23, with the apparent acquiescence of Kigali, in early December. An EAC Regional Force, led by the Kenyan military, intervened in North Kivu beginning in November 2022 but failed to calm the conflict. The force did succeed in slowing the M23’s battlefield advances, primarily through negotiations with the insurgents, preventing the rebels from capturing the city of Goma. But Kinshasa judged it ineffective as it did not go after the M23 militarily. The force left in December amid recriminations between Kinshasa, on one hand, and the EAC secretariat and Kenyan commanders, on the other. Burundi, also part of the EAC, played a different role. Its troops, both as part of the Regional Force and deployed on their own, engaged the M23 in combat. Their action drew appreciation from Kinshasa, but ire from Kigali, which accused Bujumbura of allying with the FDLR against the M23. The Burundian authorities, for their part, charge Rwanda with supporting RED-TABARA, a Burundian rebellion operating from South Kivu in the DRC. Its leaders are reported to be in exile in Kigali. On 11 January, following a deadly attack by these rebels on Burundian soil not far from the Congolese frontier, Burundi closed its border with Rwanda, barely two years after it was reopened. The spat between the two neighbours is now clearly a big part of regional tensions. Frustrated with the EAC’s failure to push back the M23, in mid-2023 President Tshisekedi invited the countries of another bloc, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), to dispatch their own troops to help turn the tide in North Kivu. The first SADC troops, principally from South Africa, arrived in Goma in December. While Kinshasa says the new force will have a resolutely offensive mandate, others are sceptical that it can make a substantial difference against well-embedded adversaries. They are also concerned that the force’s financing, currently coming from stretched national budgets, may be unsustainable.

The fighting in North Kivu [against the M23] could ... lead to deeper division between the [African] regional blocs.

The SADC deployment represents a change of dynamics at a time when regional organisations are jostling for position in the Great Lakes. In particular, South Africa has frosty relations with Rwanda. Meanwhile, Rwanda, although it did not send troops into the DRC under the now-expired EAC mandate given its support for the M23, is a key member of that bloc and enjoys good relations with the Kenyan leadership. Given those relationships, there is a perceptible degree of competition between the pro-Kinshasa southern African leaders and those of East Africa, who seem to tilt more to Kigali. The fighting in North Kivu could thereby lead to deeper division between the regional blocs. Tensions in the east took a further twist in mid-December. On 15 December, Corneille Nangaa, a former CENI head under Kabila from 2015 to 2019, announced he was forming the AFC, which as noted above is an insurgent alliance dedicated to overthrowing Tshisekedi. While nominally including a number of groups under its umbrella, the AFC seems principally aimed at widening support for the M23. Nangaa was a close ally of Kabila when the latter was president. Other known Kabila confidants, mainly from Katanga, have joined him in the AFC, raising concerns among Congolese and Great Lakes analysts and diplomats contacted by Crisis Group that Kabila’s largely Katangan entourage may be using the alliance to undermine his successor. Nangaa’s announcement of the AFC in a hotel in Kenya’s capital Nairobi added to regional frictions. The Kenya-led “Nairobi process” that, since 2022, has been trying to bring armed groups and the Congolese government to the negotiating table is also at a standstill. Kenyan authorities denied supporting the AFC, but Kinshasa nonetheless withdrew its ambassador to Nairobi in protest. Nangaa has since joined the M23 in the Rutshuru territory of North Kivu. What are Tshisekedi’s immediate priorities, and how can international partners help? The list of attendees at Tshisekedi’s second investiture ceremony hinted at the challenges his government faces in the months ahead. Southern African counterparts were prominent, as were the president’s Central African and West African peers. Kenya’s President William Ruto made the trip, as did President Evariste Ndayishimiye of Burundi who enjoys close relations with Tshisekedi. But other EAC leaders, including the Rwandan, Ugandan and Tanzanian presidents, stayed away. Tshisekedi’s sabre rattling toward Rwanda on the campaign trail, particularly likening Kagame to Hitler, has doubtless alarmed neighbours. Immediately after being declared winner, the president echoed the rhetoric, promising to “defend [our] land”, in particular by boosting recruitment and purchasing more equipment for the army. Helpfully, however, his inauguration speech took a more conciliatory line, engaging in no mudslinging with foreign leaders and recognising the need for deep reform of the armed forces. It also included conciliatory words for domestic political opponents. The president should now do more to bridge the dangerous fault lines in Congolese politics and reduce regional tensions. First, Tshisekedi and his new government must make sure that electoral mismanagement and, where apparent, fraud is investigated and sanctioned. As recommended by church authorities who led the national observer mission, Kinshasa should set up an independent commission of enquiry to shed light on the irregularities and violations of the law during the elections. It must not be left to the CENI to pass judgment on its own record. The country’s law enforcement apparatus should be involved in the investigations. Admittedly, Tshisekedi has little apparent inclination to support this move. But such a step would send a strong message of reconciliation to the opposition, in line with his inauguration speech. It would most of all signal a much-needed commitment to better electoral practice and could pave the way for better organised elections in 2028, preparations for which will start long beforehand.

Tshisekedi should seek ways to bring political debate off the street and back into the country’s institutions.

Secondly, Tshisekedi should seek ways to bring political debate off the street and back into the country’s institutions. In his inaugural address, Tshisekedi supported implementing a dormant provision in a 2007 law for a “spokesperson” (in effect, a leader) of the opposition with rank of minister, giving him or her a significant role in parliament. The holder of the position would be chosen by his or her peers in the opposition. Previous attempts at naming an opposition spokesperson have run aground, with politicians struggling to reach consensus amid opaque negotiations. It is worth another try, however, as it would help include losing candidates, and critically, the provinces they come from, in formal institutional decision-making. The opposition, part of which risks getting stuck in a dead end of refusing to acknowledge Tshisekedi’s victory, should instead welcome this initiative and put their disputes aside to find consensus on a figure who can represent them in parliament. Finally, tackling insecurity in a more sustainable fashion should be a key priority for Tshisekedi. The various military initiatives, including joint operations with neighbouring countries and other external partners, and the introduction of a “state of siege” (akin to martial law) in North Kivu and Ituri, and recruitment of new army auxiliaries drawn from pro-Kinshasa armed groups, have produced poor results. Kinshasa has persistently refused to enter negotiations with the M23, which is well embedded and strengthened by foreign support. This stance is understandable, given that the rebellion continues its advances, exposing the army’s weaknesses. Both sides should pull back. The fighting is causing immense human suffering, without Kinshasa achieving a significant military victory. Nor is the M23 able to achieve its stated political goals in the impasse. Unless it treads carefully, the Southern African force, which has little chance of making more progress on the ground than its EAC predecessor, risks adding to tensions and hurting already hamstrung diplomatic efforts. Southern African leaders should make clear from the outset that the force is intended to help stabilise the situation and enable diplomacy. They should temper any expectation in Kinshasa that the force will be a silver bullet that solves its problems in the east.

[Tshisekedi] would be well advised to seek to repair relations with his East African counterparts.

The late Gabonese president Omar Bongo Ondimba reportedly said that in Africa one does not hold elections to lose them. That certainly has been a common characteristic of elections across the continent. But on January 10, 2019, after a contentious election in the Democratic Republic of Congo—marred in irregularities and violent repression—the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) declared Félix Tshisekedi, an opposition candidate, the winner, with 38 percent. Martin Fayulu, another opposition candidate, came in second place with 34 percent, ahead of President Joseph Kabila’s chosen successor Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary, who registered 23 percent. In effect, President Joseph Kabila had lost the election.

A Backdoor Deal and Election Fraud

Following the vote on December 30, 2018, it quickly became obvious that Kabila’s candidate had lost. More astounding, it appeared that Fayulu, a former oil executive and one of Kabila’s most consistent critics, may have won. The CENI delayed the release of provisional results, setting the rumor mill agog that a fix was in. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops (CENCO), which deployed 40,000 election observers called on the CENI to publish the results that reflected the will of the people, saying that they knew the real winner. The position of the Catholic Church raised the people’s expectation and drew greater attention of the foreign press and donor countries to the CENI.

In the interim, while the Congolese awaited the election results, reports of secret talks between Tshisekedi and the Kabila camp had emerged and were confirmed at a press conference by Jean-Marc Kabund, the secretary-general of the Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS), Tshisekedi’s party. Kabund claimed that the two parties had been talking in the interest of national reconciliation as they felt they would win. His words raised suspicions of a deal with the Front Commun pour le Congo (FCC), Kabila’s coalition.

When the CENI proclaimed Tshisekedi as the winner, Fayulu challenged and rejected the provisional results. It did not comport with independent polls that showed Fayulu as the favorite to win 47 percent, over Tshisekedi and Shadary who had 24 percent and 19 percent favorability rates, respectively. Even more damning, data from the Catholic Church and files from the CENI leaked to the foreign press further pointed to massive fraud and showed that Fayulu had won the election with 62 and 59 percent, respectively. Tshisekedi had registered 15 and 18 percent. Shadary hovered around 17 and 18 percent. Based on an analysis of data files and poll surveys, Pierre Englebert, a noted scholar, concluded that the probability that Tshisekedi could have scored 38 percent in a free election was less than 0.0000.

The alleged fraud was so flagrant that the Southern African Development Community urged the CENI to recount the votes, and the African Union called a special session for heads of state to discuss developments in Congo and asked the constitutional court to suspend the final results until a high-level delegation of heads of state met with key stakeholders in Kinshasa.

Citing national sovereignty, the Kabila administration ignored the African Union’s request. The court dismissed Fayulu’s case as unfounded and without merit, and upheld Tshisekedi’s victory. Tshisekedi was sworn in as the fifth president of Congo in the first peaceful transfer of power in the country’s history on January 24.

A Congolese Conundrum

The Congolese public has reacted to Tshisekedi’s ascension with simultaneous cheer, despair, and apprehension.

On the one hand, the country’s civil society and opposition prevent Kabila, whose 18-year tenure has been defined by the looting of resources, violence, instability, and poverty, both from extending his term in office and installing his preferred successor. Popular protests, which security forces sought to bloodily repress, forestalled a constitutional amendment and defeated legislation tying the election to a national census.

Already dynamic under normal times, civil society organizations, such as the Catholic Church, increased their engagement and commitment to change. CENCO, which has been typically divided between western dioceses and eastern dioceses, many of which have been pro-Kabila in the past, channeled the people’s grievances and spoke in one voice.

Technology and social media platforms amplified the opposition’s mass mobilization through real-time videos and images in ways that made it impossible for the CENI to impose Shadary as the winner.

In a rare moment of alignment, the international community, including the foreign press, appropriated the concerns of the populations in the rejection of both Kabila and Shadary. Grants were made available to civil society organizations to enable them to carry out oversight of the electoral process.

On the other hand, Kabila may have connived with Tshisekedi to deny Fayulu his election win. Kabila is poised to remain influential in his post-presidency. His coalition has firm control of all legislative institutions; it won 350 out of 500 seats in the National Assembly and 70 percent of the seats at the provincial level, which means that Kabila’s coalition will control assemblies and governorships in all of Congo’s 26 provinces. The ramification is far-reaching, as these assemblies elect the senators who represent provinces at the upper chamber of the parliament in Kinshasa.

By law, as a former president, Kabila will be senator for life. As such, he can and may be elected president of the Senate by the FCC majority in the upper chamber, making him the second in line of succession. In case of the president’s incapacity or a similar contingency, Kabila would serve as the interim president and organize the election. He can run again.

What’s Next?

President Tshisekedi assumes power without a legitimate mandate, under the thumb of Kabila, and saddled with a daunting to-do-list. He will preside over a country as large as Western Europe, plagued by corruption, insecurity, and an untamed Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo.

In his inaugural speech, he pledged to build a “strong Congo, turned toward development in peace and security—a Congo for all, in which everyone has a place." But how should he do this?

First, Tshisekedi needs to acknowledge some of the problems with his election win. He should meet with CENCO and reconcile with Fayulu, who declared himself president-elect and called on the Congolese people to peacefully resist.

Second, he needs to show he is his own man and distance himself from Kabila. While he has no say over the FCC-controlled legislature, he could remove some of Kabila’s military and intelligence chiefs, some of whom are under EU, UN, or U.S. sanctions.

Third, Tshisekedi has to move quickly and chart an economic course and public policy that will restore the rule of law, reassure investors, and dismantle the corrupt networks that plunder the country’s financial and natural resources. Despite remarkable GDP growth rates over the years and copper and cobalt price boom, the national economy has not generated employment and mining royalties have continued to disappear into overseas private accounts.

With a contested and clouded legitimacy, Tshisekedi may initially be at the mercy of Kabila and the FCC. It will require skills and political acumen to navigate the bumpy road ahead. But if he prioritizes the welfare of the populations and delivers employment and stability, the Congolese nation would rally behind him. Now is the time to live by the motto of his late father, Etienne Tshisekedi, Le Peuple d’Abord. The people first.

Its soldiers are underpaid and underarmed. Its ranks are riddled with factions pursuing their own interests. And successive presidents are said to have kept it weak for fear of a coup.

The Democratic Republic of Congo’s army has appeared too weak and dysfunctional to stop a militia that has swept through the eastern part of the country in recent weeks. The militia, called M23, has seized two major cities, two strategic airports and large stretches of Congolese territory.

Félix Tshisekedi, the president, tried to prepare for this moment, strengthening his military to squash the thousands of fighters roaming in the east. But that response has crumbled in the face of the M23 advance, leaving Mr. Tshisekedi increasingly isolated, his domestic support evaporating, peace talks with regional powers stalled and strong international support lacking.

M23 is backed by Rwanda, Congo’s much smaller neighbor whose troops have trained, armed and embedded with the rebels, according to the United Nations. Rwanda has acknowledged that its troops are in Congo but denied controlling M23.

The Ugandan army confirmed Sunday it has sent troops to another town in the northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo to fight local armed groups, amid fears a raging conflict could spiral into a wider war.

"Our troops have entered Mahagi town, and we are in control," Uganda's defense and military affairs spokesperson Felix Kulayigye told AFP Sunday.

The deployment was requested by the Congolese army following alleged massacres of civilians carried out by a militia known as the Cooperative for the Development of Congo (CODECO), he said, without providing further details.

Mahagi is in Ituri province, which borders Uganda, where at least 51 people were killed on February 10 by armed men affiliated with CODECO, according to humanitarian and local sources.

CODECO claims it defends the interests of the Lendu community, mainly composed of farmers, against the Hema community, who are mainly herders.

Uganda already has thousands of troops in other parts of Ituri under an agreement with the Congolese government.

Last month, Uganda announced its troops had "taken control" of the provincial capital, Bunia.

Ituri is just north of the provinces of North and South Kivu, which at the end of January fell under the control of the anti-government M23 armed group, which the DRC says is backed by neighboring Rwanda. A claim that Kigali denies.

Analysts fear that Uganda and Rwanda's growing presence in eastern DRC could lead to a repeat of the so-called Second Congo War, which lasted from 1998 to 2003, involving many African countries and resulting in millions of deaths from violence, disease and famine.

Around 700,000 people were forced to leave Goma, one of the biggest cities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) when it fell in January to rebels, known as M23. With the conflict spreading, many of them are on the move again but a return home is no guarantee of safety.

On 9 February, M23 fighters gave Tumusifu, her six children and all the other residents of Bulengo displacement camp just 72 hours to leave. For the second time in a matter of weeks they would have to pick up their belongings and flee.

In January they were among the hundreds of thousands who sought refuge from the fighting when Goma fell to M23, but Bulengo is no longer safe. Going back to the city region may be the only option, but it is fraught with danger.

"We're afraid to return home," Tumusifu, a mother of six, told UN aid workers at the time. "There is still fighting in our home village. We are hungry and do not have money to help ourselves. We're waiting alongside the road because we do not know where to go."

Since then, the crisis has continued to escalate. After Goma, M23 fighters took over Bukavu, the second-largest city in eastern DRC, and other key towns, and thousands more have been displaced.

This insecurity extends to Goma itself, where there have been reports of crime and targeted violence, including home invasions and kidnappings. The UN peacekeeping mission for DRC, MONUSCO, has described the security situation in areas seized by M23 rebels as "unstable and highly unpredictable."

'Some children are starving to death'

Despite the dangers, and with nowhere else to go, Tumusifu and her family went back to their home village near Goma. Conditions are extremely precarious. "Food is our biggest need right now," she says. "Some children are starving to death. There are no medicines because the clinics are closed."

When Francine fled the displacement camp she lived in near Goma, she was separated from her husband. She fled in one direction with five of her children, whilst her husband ran in another with the couple's sixth child.

"We have not seen each other since," she said. "I'm currently taking shelter in a school, and our lives are even more challenging than they were in the camps. The most difficult thing for us is the scarcity of food and the lack of water. We have no access to a health centre."

After two of WFP's warehouses in Goma were looted, 70 per cent of the food stored there, some 9,000 metric tons, was taken, severely limiting the World Food Programme, WFP's ability to support the population.

Across the country, looting has severely disrupted humanitarian operations, leaving over 450,000 people without shelter, food, or water.

"Displaced people have not had assistance for six weeks," said Shelley Thakral, WFP spokesperson in DRC. "It is critical to bring food in - people are running out."

Markets are collapsing under the strain. A recent WFP study found that maize flour - one of the region's staples - has risen in price by almost 70 per cent, with sharp increases also seen for salt and peanut oil.

Another critical factor is transport. Goma's airport has been closed for more than two weeks, cutting off a vital humanitarian supply route, and the WFP-operated UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS) is facing a funding crisis that could see services suspended by the end of March, unless the agency can raise $33.1 million to keep the planes in the air.

Women and girls on the frontline

As conditions worsen, women and girls face an increased risk of sexual violence and exploitation. Many are attacked while searching for firewood, and in extreme cases, some resort to providing sexual services to feed their families. Female-headed households are particularly vulnerable.

"Putting food in the hands of women and providing them with livelihood opportunities is key to curbing violence targeting women and girls," said Ms. Thakral, adding that WFP plans to distribute 57 metric tons of food to support 11,000 children and pregnant or breastfeeding women at risk of severe malnutrition.

Amid all the hardship, people's dreams of returning to the homes they had before they were forced to live in displacement camps are intact.

"We will not choose a life of displacement over the peace of our homeland," said Tumusifu. "Even if we have lost everything - including our farms and our livestock - we have the skills to restart."

DR Congo conflict: 500 mpox patients flee clinics after rebel looting

28 February 2025 Share Save Dorcas Wangira BBC Africa health correspondent Share Save

Unicef Staff at Mugunga health centre in Goma have been unable to trace the 128 patients who fled at the end of January

More than 500 mpox patients have fled clinics in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo over the last month amid the current conflict. Officials at Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), a leading health agency on the continent, have said they are worried as the missing patients risk spreading the highly contagious disease that is suspected to have killed at least 900 people in DR Congo last year. The patients fled from facilities in Goma and Bukavu - two cities that descended into chaos as they were seized by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels over the past weeks. "We were looted. We lost equipment. It was a disaster," Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC.

Mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - can cause symptoms such as lesions, headaches and fever. According to Africa CDC, since the start of this year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks. What is mpox and how is it spread?

The children bearing the brunt of the mpox outbreak Dr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Goma's Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January. His health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said. At Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment. Fires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients' medical records were left strewn on the floor.

The situation has been further complicated by the M23's decision to close a network of camps in Goma where tens of thousands of people who had sought refuge from fighting in recent years. They were given 72 hours to leave last week, although the M23 later said it was encouraging "voluntary returns". "Now we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to," Dr Muhindo said. His fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC. "Once again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions," Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa CDC's mpox incident manager, said on Thursday.

Bisengimana health workers Looters made away with iron sheets, medicine, gloves and masks at Bisengimana hospital as fires were lit outside the facility

Over the last week, the Africa CDC says the number of missing mpox patients has risen by 100 as fighting escalates and the rebels take more territory. Dr Ngongo added that a new variant of mpox with "high potential for higher transmissibility" had also been detected in DR Congo. The country's ability to respond to the disease has been hampered by the conflict, between the M23 and DR Congo's army, as well as a lack of funding. The mpox facility at Mugunga, funded by the UN children's agency (Unicef) and BrItish government aid, managed to reopen last week. But it is already so overstretched that there are times when four or five patients have to share one bed.

Sadiki Bichichi Aristide arrived at the Mugunga clinic a week ago after falling sick at camp for people displaced by the fighting

"I first fled from Minova to Goma when the M23 rebels began to advance from there," Sadiki Bichichi Aristide, a 23-year-old being treated at Mugunga along with two of his children, told the BBC. "I began to fall sick in a [camp for displaced people]. It started with my fingers, and then I had lesions, which began to rupture on my hands. My neighbours told me to go to Mugunga with my children. I left my wife behind." He said he had seen "so many" people with mpox before he arrived at the clinic last week. Dr Oummani Rouafi, Unicef's Goma health specialist, told the BBC that the only reason Mugunga hospital had reopened was because staff had managed to hide some equipment and medicine from the looters. But this had not been the case at many other treatment centres that had been completely ransacked, he said.

A false alarm. Dozens of deaths and hundreds of cases which sparked panic in Congo's Equateur province have been attributed to malaria. Initial suspicions had pointed to a mystery disease.

Hundreds of individuals have been diagnosed with malaria in northwest Congo as health authorities seek to determine the reasons behind a rise in cases that has exceeded 1,000 and resulted in at least 60 fatalities.

The World Health Organization noted that while malaria, transmitted by mosquitoes, is common in Congo's Equateur province, other potential causes have not been dismissed.

The U.N. health agency indicated that it remains uncertain whether the outbreaks are interconnected.

“Comprehensive epidemiological and clinical assessments, along with additional laboratory analyses, are still required,” stated WHO's Africa office.

Nearly 1,100 cases have been documented since the initial outbreaks were identified in two villages located over 100 miles apart in late January.

Africa’s leading public health organization reported that infections have been found in five villages and is exploring whether water or food sources might be contributing to the illnesses, alongside flu and typhoid.

However, Dr. Ngashi Ngongo from the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mentioned in an online briefing that tests are primarily indicating malaria.

"Of the 70 blood smear tests conducted, approximately 78% returned positive for malaria, while rapid tests showed about 55% positivity," he explained.

Title: Why eastern DR Congo remains stuck in conflict

The M23 rebels' rapid advance is the latest chapter in eastern DR Congo's long history of instability. DW breaks down the key factors behind the ongoing turmoil.

M23 first surfaced in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2012. Thirteen years later, the rebel group is stronger than ever.

In late 2012, controlling large parts of North Kivu province and its capital city of Goma was its biggest — though short-lived — success. However, this time, Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province, also fell, with fighters advancing alongside 4,000 Rwandan troops.

How has this been possible? And what factors were different in 2013, when Congo's army finally drove the last M23 fighters out of the country, aided by troops from the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) and the newly-formed Force Intervention Brigade?

Defeat doesn't spell peace

Lasting peace is rarely achieved by disarming fighters. When M23 took up arms in 2012, it was on the pretext of the government not fulfilling its obligations laid out in a 2009 peace deal. The so-called National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP) had pledged to protect Congo's Tutsi population, but surrendered under the March 23 agreement, after which M23 is named.

"There were various attempts by the Kinshasa government to incorporate CNDP fighters into the Congolese army," said Stephanie Wolters, an expert for Africa's Great Lakes Region at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA).

"That never really worked because that integration of the CNDP wasn't complete, they became part of the Congolese army but they continued to have their own command and control, their own leadership, and they continued to pursue their own interests."

The absence of state

The state's role is crucial. Time and again, people in eastern Congo have accused the government in the capital, Kinshasa, 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) away, of making too little effort to resolve the conflict.

The security forces are poorly equipped, with no means to enforce state control over Congo's almost 2.5 million square kilometers. What is more, it is not unusual for FARDC soldiers to wait months for their pay — a further incentive to blackmail the population they are deemed to protect.

And the problem doesn't end there. An ineffective army and weak institutions create a power vacuum.

As Pacifique Zikomangane, an expert on international relations, wrote in The International Scholar: "With the absence of the Congolese army and police in these areas, armed groups have become the sole providers of security and administrative services."

From deep roots to modern power politics

Rwandan history in the Congo goes a long way back. Some of the ethnic Rwandans in eastern DRC have in fact been around for more than a century, peacefully coexisting with other ethnic groups. But stability in the region fell apart in the wake of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

Again, the events in Rwanda had their roots — and certainly, Belgian colonial divide-and-rule strategies left their mark, as Zikomangane noted.

"In an effort to subjugate the majority Hutu population, Belgian rulers adopted more divisive public policies that concentrated power in the hands of the Tutsi elite," he wrote.

The genocide ended when the Tutsi rebel group the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), led by Paul Kagame — who later became President of Rwanda — marched on Kigali. Among the hundreds of thousands who sought shelter in eastern Congo — mainly Tutsi refugees — were Hutu militias fleeing Kagame's fighters.

The region has been restive since then. And the presence of Hutu militants, today organized under the acronym FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda), more than once served Kagame with a pretext to either support militias across the border or send his troops.

Great Lakes expert Stephanie Wolters argues that with no attacks on Rwandan soil in nearly 20 years, Hutu fighters no longer pose a serious threat to Rwanda.

"So this is about something else," she told DW.

"It's about Rwanda's desire to want to control Eastern DRC for its own purposes, and that's really what's happening here. And that's one of the things we have seen over the last few weeks, the expansion of the control of the territory that M23 now holds with the capturing of Goma and Bukavu."

Battling for Congo's mineral wealth

Eastern Congo is home to significant quantities of gold and much of the world's coltan reserves. The mineral group is crucial for laptops and smartphones. According to Richard Moncrieff from the International Crisis Group, raw materials have played a decisive role in the conflicts since the 1990s.

"Both Congolese armed groups and foreign armies including Rwanda's, Burundi's and Uganda's have all intervened in DRC partly as a kind of geopolitical rivalry. They're all trying to push each other back and maintain control over what they see as their areas of influence," said Moncrieff.

"[Lots of] minerals have been shipped out into those three countries, gold, coltan and others, and that fuels the war economy and it's certainly a factor that motivates neighboring countries to intervene in DRC either directly or through proxy armed groups."

Among the triggers for M23's resurgence, observers cite Congo's security partnerships with Uganda and Burundi, while talks with Rwanda failed.

The restraint of the international community

After years of absence, M23 resumed attacks in eastern Congo around four years ago.

Why has it not been possible to push back the rebel group during this time, as was possible in 2013?

In a DW interview at the end of January, Martin Kobler, the former head of the UN mission in Congo, criticized the UN peacekeeping forces for failing to take decisive action, even though they still had a robust mandate.

Next to joint military operations, it was massive international pressure that led to the M23's defeat in 2013. Bowing to that pressure, Kagame also withdrew his support for the militia. Today, the situation is different. Only a few actors took a clear stand in condemning Rwanda's intervention, said Stephanie Wolters.

"The Americans have always been quite clear, the Belgians have been quite clear. France has flipflopped. The UK for a long time was on Rwanda's side because of their own asylum deal. The EU has been all over the place because it's difficult to get consensus," Wolters said.

"So it took an incredibly long time and there's been a lot of reluctance to go down the road of sanctions or condemnation or any kind of punitive action on Rwanda."

What would happen if all foreign forces left the Congo? To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video

Perhaps even more alarming is the fact that African actors have remained almost invisible, as Wolters puts it. Peace efforts in Luanda and Nairobi ultimately failed. Rwanda's President Kagame has thus far refused to withdraw his support for the M23. Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi, on the other hand, firmly opposes direct negotiations with the M23, whom he considers no more than Kagame's proxy army. When the UN Security Council recently met to discuss the situation in eastern Congo, it was its three African members who opposed a clear condemnation of Rwanda.

There are reasons for this reluctance. "Rwanda is strategically extremely smart. And they have known how to make themselves useful," Wolters pointed out.

"Kagame also led AU reform. He's got a really good diplomatic corps. He's got senior people in important positions like head of the francophonie or SRSGs [Special Representatives of the Secretary General, or heads of mission] in different UN peacekeeping missions. And all of this has been cultivated deliberately. And it puts him in a different league than the DRC, if I can put it that way."

Part of Rwanda's strategy consists of contributing peacekeeping troops to Mozambique and the Central African Republic, making it even more indispensable for the international community.

However, experts agree that a harder stance towards Rwanda is the only way forward: Rwanda, which is still dependent on development aid, will only reconsider its role in the Congo under international pressure.

More than 5 million people were already displaced across the eastern states of North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri.

As UN agencies reported "relative calm" on Wednesday in the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), humanitarians warned that the chaos caused by advancing M23 rebel forces could fuel a region-wide health emergency.

The internet also remains down in the provincial capital and only mobile phone networks are functioning, with M23 fighters apparently in control of "a significant portion of the city" after intense clashes with the Congolese army, UN agencies reported on Wednesday.

Aid teams from the UN World Health Organization (WHO) "cannot move freely to support the hospitals, even ambulances cannot run. It's a situation that in public health is a nightmare," said Dr Boureima Hama Sambo, WHO Representive in DRC.

'Vulnerable people need us'

Speaking to UN News, Dr Sambo added: "We just hope that the situation will return to normal for the Government ... vulnerable people really need us."

Conditions in provincial capital Goma remain "dire", he added, with no running water, electricity cut and civilians trapped - including health professionals.

Echoing those concerns, a senior UN peacekeeping official warned that the level of suffering among those caught up in the violence was "unimaginable".

Vivian van de Perre, Deputy Special Representative for Protection and Operations in the UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) told the Security Council late Tuesday that there was a need for "urgent and coordinated international action" to stop the fighting between Rwanda-backed M23 rebels and Congolese forces as they battled for control of Goma.

Massive displacement and fear

Before M23 fighters closed in on Goma, more than 700,000 internally displaced people lived around the provincial capital. But hundreds of thousands fled in anticipation of clashes between the Rwanda-backed rebels and DRC troops, prompting renewed alarm about the further spread of deadly disease.

"When you have as many as 700,000 people living in camps, you can imagine the human suffering," the WHO official told UN News, pointing to "a lot of ongoing [disease] outbreaks" in North and South Kivu - two mineral-rich regions close to the Rwanda border, where dozens of armed groups have held sway for decades.

Disease ever-present

Repeated mass displacement in DRC has created ideal conditions for the spread of many endemic diseases in camps and surrounding communities in the Kivus, including cholera (more than 22,000 cases and 60 deaths in 2024), measles (close to 12,000 cases and 115 deaths) and malaria, as well as chronic child malnutrition.

In August last year, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.

Despite a "robust" initial response to the mpox threat by WHO and national partners that has been coordinated from Kinshasa and field offices in Goma and South Kivu, Dr Sambo warned that mpox patients had fled at least one camp's treatment centre and were now living now in host communities and with families.

"So, we are there's a fear for the disease to be spreading widely in communities, but at this point we cannot say because we have not been able to get there and assess what's happening right now."

At least 700 killed in DR Congo fighting since Sunday - UN

31 January 2025 Share Save Jaroslav Lukiv BBC News Share Save

EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock After capturing Goma, M23 rebels are now reported to be advancing on Bukavu

The UN says at least 700 people have been killed in intense fighting in Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, since Sunday. UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said 2,800 people have been injured, as M23 rebels - backed by Rwanda - captured the capital of North Kivu province. The rebels are now reported to be moving south towards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu. The conflict in eastern DR Congo dates back to the 1990s but has rapidly escalated in recent weeks. M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for minority rights, while DR Congo's government says the Rwanda-backed rebels are seeking control of the eastern region's vast mineral wealth.

On Friday, Dujarric said the casualty figures came from an assessment made by the World Health Organization and its partners, alongside the DR Congo's government, between Sunday and Thursday. The UN spokesman also warned the death toll would rise further. In an attempt to halt M23's progress, the DR Congo military has set up a defensive line on the road between Goma and Bukavu, according to the AFP news agency. Hundreds of civilian volunteers have been enlisted to defend Bukavu. One young man told the AFP: "I am ready to die for my country." Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki, the governor of South Kivu - the province M23 are marching on - told Reuters news agency the government army and its allies were holding back the rebels, though that claim has not been independently verified. Earlier this week, M23 vowed to continue its offensive until it reached the capital Kinshasa, about 2,600km (1,600 miles) to the west.

Latest reports from Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) from UN teams on the ground indicate a fast-deteriorating situation on Tuesday amid an ongoing assault by M23 rebels on the provincial capital.

Dead bodies lie in the streets, hospitals are overwhelmed and there has been an uptick in reports of sexual violence, rape and looting.

"Roads are blocked, ports are closed and those crossing Lake Kivu risk their lives in makeshift boats," said Shelley Thakral, spokesperson for the UN World Food Programme (WFP) - one of many UN agencies on the ground striving to provide assistance and protection wherever possible. "I spoke just moments ago to an activist In Goma and he told me, 'We're here, we're hiding. We don't know who will come to help us."'

The UN aid coordination office, OCHA, echoed the humanitarian community's deep concerns about the spiralling violence across the resource-rich region that has uprooted some 300,000 people from camps around Goma in a matter of days.

Aid targeted

"Our colleagues in the DRC report heavy, small arms fire and mortar fire across the city and the presence of many dead bodies in the streets," said OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke. "We have reports of rapes committed by fighters, looting of property, including of a humanitarian warehouse and humanitarian and health facilities being hit."

The emergency has left hospitals in Goma reportedly overwhelmed by the influx of wounded people, electricity and water supplies "compromised" and internet services cut off on Monday. "Goma is still offline this morning," Mr. Laerke told journalists in Geneva.

The development came amid urgent calls from the international community including the Security Council in New York, where ambassadors on Tuesday demanded an immediate halt to the M23 rebel offensive and called for the group to withdraw from territories it has seized.

The ambassadors reiterated their support for the UN peacekeeping force in the DR Congo, MONUSCO, and paid tribute to blue helmets who have lost their lives from South Africa, Malawi and Uruguay in recent days.

The Council also condemned the presence of "external forces" in eastern DRC - amid reports Rwandan troops are heavily involved in the offensive - and called for all parties to adhere to the ceasefire and return to diplomatic talks.

Years of crisis

Before the latest escalation in violence in eastern DRC's Kivus, some 5.1 million people had already been displaced by years of insecurity in the mineral-rich region and forced to live in overcrowded camps with little food and no security.

UN agencies and partners continue to monitor the highly unstable situation which has forced WFP to temporarily pause food assistance activities in around Goma. "The airport and major access roads within the region have been cut off...Depending on the duration of violence, the supply of food into the city could be severely hampered," said WFP's Ms. Thakral.

"This is a huge test for Congolese trapped by fighting in Goma and surrounding areas...the next 24 hours will be critical as people start to run low on supplies and will need to see what they can find to survive."

Disease fears

The highly mobile nature of the emergency has prompted additional fears that existing diseases may spread quickly among uprooted populations, although preventive measures were taken before the latest escalation, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) said.

For the moment the immediate concern is to help victims of the violence.

"There are currently hundreds of people in hospital, most admitted with gunshot and shrapnel wounds, with secondary infections becoming a health risk," said Dr Adelheid Marschang, Emergency Response Coordinator for the DRC.

She noted that before Goma airport closed on Saturday, WHO had sent critical medical supplies for trauma and emergency care, infection prevention, cholera and more.

The UN agency's response to the crisis has also included providing tents for hospitals to cope with the increasing number of injured. It has medical hubs in North and South Kivu, in the cities of Goma and Bukavu to support health care needs in eastern DRC.

Last year the provinces of North and South Kivu reported high numbers of cholera, measles and malaria cases and deaths, Dr. Marschang said, warning of a "heightened risk for spillover of cholera" into neighbouring countries and provinces.

The area was also the epicentre of an outbreak of a new strain of mpox, declared a public health emergency of international concern in August 2024. Dr. Marschang warned that the new wave of displacement will make it increasingly hard to track and treat the disease.

Amid the lethal violence, hospitals and health workers themselves are in danger, the WHO official said, with "reports of health workers being shot at and patients including babies being caught in crossfire".

"Attacks on healthcare violate the rules of war. Healthcare must be protected at all times," she insisted.

Sexual violence alert

WHO and other UN agencies and partners said that they are especially worried about the increasing risk to women and girls from violence, including rape.

"Pregnant women are at risk, with very high maternal death rates, even before the violence escalated," WHO said.

"Sadly, hospitals and health workers are in danger. We are hearing reports of health workers being shot at, and patients, including babies, being caught in the crossfire. WHO reminds everyone that attacks on healthcare violate the rules of war. Health care must be protected at all times."

Echoing those concerns, WFP's Ms. Thakral reported that mobile teams and mobile clinics are at work amid reports that women had been raped multiple times while searching for firewood or after leaving the perimeter of their camp.

Other reports indicated "an increase in rape along the pathways that some of the conflict partners are now taking into South Kivu," she said, underscoring the agency's efforts "to have some solutions to follow the populations as they move".

The UN also expressed concerns over executions it learned were carried out by the rebels which came after a major escalation of their years-long rebellion in the mineral-rich region.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the World Health Organisation and its partners conducted an assessment with DR Congo’s government between Jan. 26-30 “and report that 700 people have been killed and 2,800 injured” in Goma and the vicinity.

“These numbers are expected to rise as more information becomes available,” he said.

The rebels were now about 60 kilometres from South Kivu's provincial capital of Buakavu and “seem to be moving quite fast,” U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix said at a press briefing on Friday. M23 has captured several towns after seizing neighbouring Goma, a humanitarian hub critical for many of the six million people displaced by the conflict.

The central African nation’s military has been weakened after it lost hundreds of personnel and foreign mercenaries surrendered to the rebels after the fall of Goma.

Goma's capture has brought humanitarian operations to “a standstill, cutting off a vital lifeline for aid delivery across eastern (DR Congo)," said Rose Tchwenko, country director for Mercy Corps aid group in DR Congo. “The escalation of violence toward Bukavu raises fears of even greater displacement, while the breakdown of humanitarian access is leaving entire communities stranded without support."

The Southern African regional bloc, of which DR Congo is a member, resolved on Friday to maintain its peacekeeping force deployed in eastern DR Congo in 2023. The group's chairman, Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa, called for “bold” and "decisive steps” to boost the force’s capacity. At their meeting in Zimbabwe's capital Harare, the 16-nation bloc also pledged to work towards a ceasefire.

At the United Nations, France circulated a draft Security Council resolution to all 15 members on Friday urging a halt to the current offensive in eastern DR Congo, the withdrawal of “foreign elements,” and a resumption of talks to achieve a cessation of hostilities, France’s U.N. Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere said. He expressed hope it can be adopted soon.

The M23 group is the most potent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world’s technology. They are backed by around 4,000 troops from neighbouring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first captured Goma for days in a conflict driven by ethnic grievances.

Observers say that unlike the rebels' first takeover in DR Congo, their withdrawal could be more difficult now.

The rebels have been emboldened by Rwanda, which feels Congo is ignoring its interests in the region and failed to meet demands of previous peace agreements, according to Murithi Mutiga, programme director for Africa at the Crisis Group think tank. “Ultimately, this is a failure of African mediation - the warning signs were always there," said Mutiga.

U.N. human rights office spokesman Jeremy Laurence spoke at a briefing on Friday about the worsening human rights crisis in the aftermath of the rebellion, including bomb strikes on at least two internally displaced persons camps that killed an unspecified number of people.

“We have also documented summary executions of at least 12 people by M23 from Jan. 26-28," Laurence said, adding that the group has also occupied schools and hospitals in the province and are subjecting civilians to forced conscription and forced labour.

Congolese forces have also been accused of sexual violence as fighting rages on in the region, Laurence said.

“We are verifying reports that 52 women were raped by Congolese troops in South Kivu, including alleged reports of gang rape,” he said.

An attack by the rebels in Kalehe territory, about 140 kilometres from the South Kivu provincial capital, on Thursday was repelled by security forces, said Lt. Gen. Pacifique Masunzu, who commands a key military defence zone in South Kivu.

Congolese military bases in Bukavu were being emptied on Thursday to reinforce those along the way to the provincial capital, residents have told The Associated Press.

Dujarric, the U.N. spokesman, said the United Nations has about 1,200 international and national staff and dependents in Bukavu. “We’re moving some people out of there as a precaution,” he said.

Hundreds of young people on Friday registered as volunteers to join military training in the provincial capital, according to Gabriel Kasanji, a local administrative officer. This follows Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi’s call on Thursday for a mass military mobilisation.

As he took office on Friday as the new governor of North Kivu, which includes Goma, Maj. Gen. Somo Kakule Evariste vowed to “move as soon as possible” to Goma to restore government control.

“This is not the time for speeches,” the general said. “The flame of resistance will never be extinguished.”

In Goma, U.N. peacekeeping chief Lacroix said “the situation remains tense and volatile, with occasional shooting continuing within the city.”

Overall, calm is gradually being restored and water and electricity have been restored in much of Goma, but the airport remains closed and the runway unusable, he said.

The U.N. peacekeeping force in the city, known as MONUSCO, continues to grapple with unexploded ordnance that is “a very serious obstacle to freedom of movement,” Lacroix said.

“We are going to struggle until we restore democracy,” said Corneille Nangaa, one of the political leaders of M23. “From a failed state to a modern state."

Severe shortages of food and water are threatening the lives of thousands of people fleeing Eastern Congo amid escalating violence, according to World Food Program.

The U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Congo said basic services are largely paralyzed in Goma, a humanitarian hub critical for more than 6 million people displaced by the conflict.

The camps for displaced persons on the outskirts of Goma, which previously housed more than 300,000 people, have emptied due to the advancement of the Rwanda-backed rebels.

Several WFP warehouses have been looted, and are in turn, limiting civilian access to food.

“People are really running out of food, clean water, medical supplies and that's a big concern,” said WFP spokesperson Shelley Thakral.

“The supply chain has really been strangled at the moment if you think about land access, air access, when everything is closed down,” she added.

Their priority is to secure staff safety and then get back to operations “as soon as security allows us to," she stressed.

The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first captured Goma.

They are one of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits estimated to be worth $24 trillion that are critical to much of the world’s technology.

The recent violence marks a sharp escalation in one of Africa’s longest wars, threatening to dramatically worsen a dire humanitarian crisis.

The rebels' offensive has sent hundreds of thousands fleeing their homes, in addition to 1 million displaced who are already in Goma, and stretched hospitals to the limit, with hundreds of wounded coming in every day as civilians get caught in the crossfire.

SADC leaders held crisis talks in Zimbabwe as M23 rebels advance on Bukavu, just days after seizing Goma. The UN says at least 700 people have been killed since Sunday.

The M23 rebel group was advancing towards Bukavu in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) a UN expert said on Friday, just days after the group seized the key eastern city of Goma.

Bukavu is the capital of South Kivu province and home to hundreds of thousands of people.

Rwandan-backed M23 rebels entered Goma, the capital of North Kivu and the largest city in eastern Congo, on Monday.

Large parts of the city are now under rebel control in what's considered the worst escalation of a long-running conflict in more than a decade.

UN expert says M23 not far from Bukavu

UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said that M23 fighters and Rwandan Defence Force (RDF) were around 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Bukavu and were moving towards a major airport, north of the city.

Rwanda denies backing the rebels, but the UN has made repeated calls for Kigali to withdraw forces from DRC and bring an end to support for the group.

The UN meanwhile said that 700 people have been killed and another 2,800 injured since the latest escalation.

The DRC accuses Rwanda of looking to exploit the region's mineral wealth. Rwanda denies this and says its primary objective is to eradicate a group composed of Hutu militants formed in the wake of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

SADC leaders pledge 'unwavering commitment'

Leaders from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) held crisis talks in Zimbabwe on Friday.

The regional bloc reaffirmed its "solidarity and unwavering commitment to continue supporting the DRC in its pursuit of safeguarding its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity."

SADC leaders called for an immediate joint summit of SADC and the East African Community (EAC) of which Rwanda and the DRC are members.

The summit condemned the deadly attacks on the SADC Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (SAMIDRC) regional intervention force.

The SADC mission began deploying troops in DRC in December 2023 after Kinshasa sought support under the bloc's mutual defense pact.

Uganda protest organisers playing with fire, president says

Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has been in power since 1986

In a televised address, Mr Museveni warned the Ugandan organisers that their planned protest would not be tolerated.

They have been partly inspired by their counterparts in neighbouring Kenya, who organised mass demonstrations that forced President William Ruto to drop plans to increase taxes. The protests have since morphed into calls for his resignation.

Young Ugandans have been organising the march on social media to demand an end to corruption in government.

Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has warned protesters that they will be "playing with fire" if they press ahead with plans to stage an anti-corruption march to parliament on Tuesday.

"We are busy producing wealth… and you here want to disturb us. You are playing with fire because we cannot allow you to disturb us," he said.

Mr Museveni is accused by his critics of ruling Uganda with an iron hand since taking power in 1986, but his supporters praise him for maintaining stability in the East African state.

The president also accused some of the protest organisers of "always working with foreigners" to cause chaos in Uganda. He did not elaborate.

Police had earlier announced that they had refused to give permission for the march to take place.

One of the main protest leaders told AFP news agency that they would go ahead with it.

"We don't need police permission to carry out a peaceful demonstration. It is our constitutional right," Louez Aloikin Opolose was quoted as saying.

The UK and US governments imposed sanctions on Uganda's parliamentary speaker, Anita Annet Among, earlier this year after she was accused of corruption.

She has denied any wrongdoing.

The sanctions bar her from travelling to the UK and the US. The UK also said that it would impose an asset freeze on her.

The UK has enforced similar sanctions on two government ministers who were sacked by Mr Museveni after they too were accused of corruption.

Mary Goretti Kitutu and Agnes Nandutu have been charged in court over a scandal involving the theft of thousands of metal roofing sheets that were intended for vulnerable communities in the north-eastern Karamoja region.

Both have denied the charges.

In Kenya, President Ruto also called for an end to the protests that have hit his government, saying: "Enough is enough.”

The protests are the biggest in Kenya since Mr Ruto took office after winning elections in 2022.

Activists have planned further demonstrations for Tuesday to demand his resignation and for an end to what they call bad governance.

Addressing a rally in western Bomet County, Mr Ruto said the protest organisers could not remain "anonymous", and should “step forward and tell us what is this violence going to achieve”.

Some protesters stormed parliament last month setting part of it on fire and stealing the mace, the symbol of the legislature's authority.

Protest organisers say their demonstrations have largely been peaceful.

They accuse the police and the military of responding with brute force, and killing peaceful protesters.

At least 50 protesters have been killed and 413 injured since the protests started on 18 June, according to the state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.

Kenya's main opposition leader Raila Odinga has expressed solidarity with the protesters, saying there had to be justice for victims before any talks with the government could take place.

Mr Odinga's position could undermine Mr Ruto's attempt to include members of the opposition in his cabinet - a move which the hopes will help end the youth-led protests.

Monrovia — The escalating violence in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has affected testing for the infectious mpox virus disease, which has afflicted thousands in the country and the wider region.

Speaking at the weekly press briefing of the Africa Centers for Disease Control (Africa CDC), the center's Deputy Incident Manager in the DR Congo, Professor Yap Boum said the disruption caused by the fighting "reinforces the need for the decentralization of the testing lab".

The country is one of 12 considered to still have "active cases" of the disease; and is amongst three countries on the continent harboring more than 90 percent of total mpox infections. Uganda and Burundi are the other two most infected countries. Boum said the African health watchdog was "notified" of more than 500 cases of the disease in Uganda in the fourth week of reporting in 2025, out of which a little over 300 were confirmed.

The Africa CDC official said Uganda's capital Kampala is considered the hot spot, with cases more prevalent amongst youth within the age range of 18-29, which, he says, raises the suspicion that it is being sexually transmitted. "This makes it very complex to do contact tracing because of confidentiality."

There've been more than 13,000 suspected cases from "week 1 to week 4" of the 2025 reporting period, the center said. Out of this number, more than 3000 have been confirmed in 12 countries with 107 deaths. Nine countries have "controlled cases", five of which no longer have cases - including Mauritius, South Africa, Morocco, and Gabon.

Boum expressed optimism that the start of mpox vaccination in Uganda could be a "game-changer". He was referring to the 10,000 doses of vaccines the country received in January 2025 from the European Commission, while expressing distress over the outbreak of Ebola in the East African nation.

"We should support the fight against Ebola; not at the expense of mpox," Boum said.

More than 100 women raped and burned alive in DR Congo jailbreak, UN says

Footage from the jailbreak shows people fleeing from the building as black smoke rises into the air

The report states that most of the women were killed after the inmates set fire to the prison.

Between 165 and 167 women were assaulted by male inmates during the jailbreak, an internal UN document seen by the BBC says.

Hundreds of prisoners broke out of Munzenze prison last Monday, after fighters from the M23 rebel group began to take over the city.

More than 100 female prisoners were raped and then burned alive during a jailbreak in the Congolese city of Goma, according to the UN.

The BBC has not been able to verify the reports.

Goma, a major city of more than a million people, was captured after the Rwanda-backed M23 executed a rapid advance through eastern DR Congo.

The city was plunged into chaos, with bodies lying in the streets and missiles reportedly flying over residential homes.

Footage from last week's jailbreak showed people fleeing from the building as smoke rose in the background. Heavy gunfire could also be heard.

In a separate video, people believed to be the escaped prisoners, filed through Goma's streets.

The UN says at least 2,900 people were killed during the fighting, with 2,000 bodies buried and another 900 still in the city's morgues.

Earlier this week, the rebels announced a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds.

However, the M23 launched a new offensive on Wednesday, sources say, reportedly capturing the mining town of Nyabibwe.

Nyabibwe is about 100 km (60 miles) from Bukavu - the east's second-largest city, and the reported target of the rebels' most recent advance.

The Congolese authorities have enlisted hundreds of civilian volunteers to help defend Bukavu.

Meanwhile, Malawi has announced it will start preparations for a withdrawal of its peacekeeping forces from the country. This follows the killing of three of its soldiers in the fighting around Goma.

They were part of a southern African force, led by South Africa. Although 14 South Africans have been killed, President Cyril Ramaphosa has vowed to keep his forces in the country.

Back in Goma, where residents are adapting to life under the M23, there are fears of a cholera outbreak.

Stephan Goetghbuer, a regional lead from the charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said: "Access to water has been cut for days, corpses have been lying in the streets and waterborne diseases such as cholera are a real threat.

"Some of our cholera treatment centres are full and have been expanded."

African leaders asked defense chiefs for a road map to end the conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Their emergency talks in Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea come as the long-running crisis escalates.

History will judge leaders in Africa who fail to end the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, President Samia Suluhu Hassan of Tanzania warned her counterparts at the start of an emergency summit over the weekend.

"For the last couple of weeks, we have witnessed the spread of violence that has caused massive harm to human life, massive displacement and insecurity which affected economic activities and disrupted cross-border trade," Hassan said.

The East African Community (EAC) and Southern African Development Community (SADC) convened a brief joint summit in Tanzania on February 8 as the conflict escalated.

DRC President Felix Tshisekedi did not join the meeting in person, but appeared via video link from the capital, Kinshasa. Presidents Paul Kagame of Rwanda, Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, William Ruto of Kenya and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda were among those who traveled to Dar es Salaam.

Ceasefire, dialogue, peace

Tshisekedi and Kagame, who is accused of fueling the conflict, did not deliver speeches. Mnangagwa and Ruto spoke only briefly as chairpersons of the EAC and SADC respectively.

A few hours after the talks opened, the blocs issued a joint statement in which the leaders said they had asked security chiefs to provide a road map towards peace.

"The joint summit directed the EAC and SADC chiefs of defence forces to meet within five days and provide technical direction on immediate and unconditional ceasefire and cessation of hostilities," it read.

Mnangagwa, the chairperson of SADC, and Ruto both said the conflict could not be resolved by military means. "The leaders also called for resumption of all forms of dialogue to end the crisis," according to the joint statement.

Rwanda told to 'disengage'

The EAC-SADC talks opened on ministerial level on February 7, with leaders of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) holding an emergency meeting in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea.

In a statement, the ECCAS bloc urged the M23 rebels to stop their offensive in order to help address the dire humanitarian crisis, saying: "We strongly condemn the M23 armed group supported by Rwanda and call upon them to immediately end their offensive."

The bloc also called for the immediate withdrawal of Rwandan armed forces. The EAC-SADC statement also urged the "lifting of Rwanda's defensive measures and disengagement of forces from DRC."

How experts see the latest crisis talks

A Tanzania-based political analyst, Paternus Niyegira, told DW that the Dar es Salaam summit was a major starting point toward ending the war.

"In the short term, the parties must consider the humanitarian activity to take course in eastern DR Congo. But in the long term is to work with all parties [including M23 rebels] to ensure that they have a stable state," he said.

Observers of the Great Lakes region say the deep tensions between Tshisekedi and Kagame has complicated the conflict.

"When the two personalities don't see eye to eye, sitting around the negotiating table is always difficult," Fidel Amakye Owusu, a Ghana-based security and international relations analyst, told DW. That also poses a constant risk of armed conflict that escalates.

Ruto told the summit that the conflict in DRC can't be resolved militarily. "Only a diplomatic approach, one that addresses the root causes of the crisis, secures the historic integrity and territorial integrity of DRC and affirms the sovereignty of the people and the aspiration of freedom justice and development, that is what would establish peace," the Kenyan leader said.

Mnangagwa called on the summit to come up with a realistic resolution to the conflict and asked his counterparts to sustain their commitments toward bringing relief to the millions of Congolese in distress.

Niyegira said African leaders could deliver an effective outcome from the summit "only if there would be a level of political honesty in their discussions."

African leaders should draw inspiration from previous efforts to broker peace in DRC, he said.

Congolese missing, killed

The M23 rebel capture of Goma in late January led to the killing of more than 2,700 people dead, a UN representative in the DRC said in early February. Independent observers say the number could be much higher.

Mass burials, organized by rebel leaders and Red Cross workers, are taking place as many families in Goma say the bodies of their loved ones have not yet been found.

At one of the mass burials, Odette Maliyetu told DW that her son, a Congolese soldier, has been missing since the militia captured the city. "Every day we visit our relatives and family members, hoping to find our son, who is serving in the army. We haven't found him yet, and we couldn't reach him by phone. We don't know whether he's alive or dead," she told DW.

"Here, where bodies are buried, it's difficult to identify them because they're wrapped up," Maliyetu said. "It's impossible to identify a loved one. We're disappointed, and we're going home."

Most of the people being buried were killed in bombings or by stray bullets. "My grandmother died after a bomb exploded," Chance Nzabanita, told DW.

The EAC-SADC leaders expressed concern about the people killed and the humanitarian crisis affecting women and children in particular. The crisis, they said in their statement, was also "manifesting in attacks on diplomatic missions, embassies, and staff based in Kinshasa."

The security situation in the city of Goma is deteriorating, and journalists can no longer report, the media has been forced into silence, there is no stable access to electricity or the internet. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is urgently alerting the international community to this crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and calling on the parties involved in conflict to respect and protect the public’s right to information.

Communications with journalists in Goma are rare and sporadic, thanks to unstable electricity and internet that has plagued the city since the advance of the M23, an armed rebel group backed by the Rwandan army. The M23 now controls the key points of this town, the most populous in the province of North Kivu.

Almost all local and international radio stations have stopped broadcasting in the area. The headquarters of the local branch of Radio Télévision Nationale du Congo (RTNC) has been empty since 27 January. “No RTNC staff are present at the station,” provincial director Tuver Wundi told RSF. The people of Goma now rely on the Rwandan radio stations broadcasting from the neighbouring town of Gisenyi for information.

The media professionals that RSF was able to contact all expressed an urgent need to evacuate the area. Yet, at the time of this writing, there was no safe way out; as Valéry Mukosasenge, director of the Goma-based online website larepublique.net, explained to RSF. Only the journalists from the United Nations radio station in the DRC, Radio Okapi, have been evacuated to Kigali, the Rwandan capital, with their families.

“The deteriorating security situation is drastically challenging the right to information in Goma, which has become a refuge for displaced journalists from the province for several months. Radio stations have fallen silent, and journalists have been forced to leave their workplaces and are being attacked and persecuted. Any solution to this dire crisis must factor in the protection of and respect for the right to information. RSF calls on all parties involved in the conflict to ensure that the media can do their work freely — and to protect journalists.”

The nightmare facing displaced journalists

The M23's advance into Goma is the apex of the attacks on journalism that have occured during the ongoing conflict in North Kivu. Since January 2024, over 25 radio stations have closed due to violent clashes and looting, and many journalists have been displaced to refugee camps in Goma.

The situation has worsened in the past few days. On 24 January, a community radio director — who remains anonymous for security reasons — expressed his concern to RSF: “We no longer know what to do to escape the bombs that are falling on civilians.” Some journalists have managed to find refuge in military camps. Others are hiding as best they can, waiting for the situation to stabilise. Five of the journalists RSF spoke to have been displaced since July and have managed to leave the city and take refuge further south.

Attacks on journalists

Among the journalists assaulted during the conflict is Sky News journalist Yousra Elbagir, who was attacked by unidentified assailants on 26 January in a village north of Goma while covering the massive movement of displaced people fleeing towards the city. Essential professional equipment, including a camera and two telephones, were stolen. Journalist Samuel Adiba of Go FM, a radio station dedicated to women's rights, was attacked and his professional equipment stolen by “Wazalendo”, local militiamen who have partnered with the Congolese military.

The DRC is ranked 123rd out of 180 countries and territories in the RSF 2024 World Press Freedom Index.

People living in camps, like Nzulo camp, are fleeing to Goma as fightings take place some kilometers away.

In recent weeks, the armed conflict in the DRC between the M23/AFC and the Congolese army, backed by their allies, has flared up again in the province of North Kivu and spread to the neighbouring province of South Kivu. Emmanuel Lampaert, MSF's representative in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), provides an update on the situation and MSF's response.

According to the United Nations, 400,000 people have already fled since January. Tens of thousands headed for displacement sites around Goma, where more than 650,000 people were already living, exhausted by almost three years of fighting. Emmanuel Lampaert, MSF's representative in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)

What is the current situation in the Kivus with regard to the conflict in DRC?

Since December 2024, several fronts have been opened in the two provinces to control certain key positions. In Lubero territory, in North Kivu, the conflict resumed in December with massive population displacement. It continued in Masisi territory, where intense fighting took place in January 2025, particularly for control of the town of Masisi Centre, before moving down towards South Kivu to Minova and Numbi in Kalehe territory.

During the hostilities, the M23/AFC managed to take control of several towns. Recently, the fighting has moved closer to the provincial capital of Goma, with intense clashes in Sake, just 20 kilometres from the city. Artillery explosions can be heard regularly from Goma. Fighting is taking place on all the roads around Goma and has led to a new influx of displaced people into the city, including from some camps on the outskirts of the city, where people flee towards Goma in a situation of panic

How is this situation affecting the population?

Unsurprisingly, the humanitarian consequences for the population are very serious. Hundreds of thousands of people have once again fled the fighting because of the conflict in the DRC. According to the United Nations, 400,000 people have already fled since January. Tens of thousands headed for displacement sites around Goma, where more than 650,000 people were already living, exhausted by almost three years of fighting. The clashes in recent weeks have led to a new influx of people into these completely unhygienic sites, whereas we have been saying for far too long – families are surviving without proper shelter and lacking everything: food, water, health care, etc.

Unfortunately, these sites are not spared from the fighting. Rockets are being fired near these camps or the health facilities where people have sought shelter. It's appalling and unacceptable. We are also seeing a very worrying proportion of civilians among the hundreds of wounded we are helping to treat. Some are victims of stray bullets, but others are victims of the warring parties' failure to respect certain basic rules of conflict.

In Masisi, the hospital we support came under fire while more than 10,000 people were seeking shelter. Two people were hit just outside the hospital, and two of our staff were injured by rocket fire. The presence of combatants or artillery positions near health facilities and camps for internally displaced people puts lives at immediate risk. It is crucial for everyone to remember that even war has its rules.

What is MSF's current response on the ground?

We are doing our utmost to maintain our regular and emergency activities, but in some areas, we have had to limit the risks by reducing the size of our teams. Around Goma, for example, direct armed violence has reduced our ability to go to certain affected sites over the past two days. However, we continue to supply medical facilities, help them prepare for an influx of wounded, and bring in fuel to run water pumps as soon as conditions allow. This allows these facilities to continue to function, even with a more limited presence of our teams.

In Goma itself, we continue to support the Kyeshero Hospital in treating some of the wounded and relieving the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which is on the front line treating the wounded at the Ndosho hospital. It is clear that the hospitals in Goma are completely overwhelmed by the number of wounded.

In the rest of North and South Kivu, despite the security, logistical challenges, and restrictions on movement, we are maintaining our presence and continuing to treat patients, including the wounded. In three weeks, nearly 400 casualties have been treated at the Minova General Referral Hospital, the Numbi Hospital Centre and the Masisi General Referral Hospital. As the conflict in the DRC continues, We are also continuing to support displaced people in more remote areas, such as Lubero, where we are also working to improve access to water in health facilities and at the Magasin site for displaced people.

With the fall of Goma people face a worst-case scenario in humanitarian terms.

United Nations — There was gunfire Tuesday in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo city of Goma, as the United Nations warned of a worrying humanitarian situation amid clashes between Congolese soldiers and Rwandan-backed rebels who attacked the area and claimed to be in control.

U.N. humanitarian office spokesperson Jens Laerke told a briefing Tuesday that hospitals in Goma were overwhelmed.

The World Food Program said it temporarily paused food assistance activities in the Goma area.

Crisis talks were planned for Wednesday, Kenyan President William Ruto said, with Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame set to attend.

Ruto said there is no military solution to the conflict.

The U.S. State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio "condemned the assault on Goma by the Rwanda-backed M23 and affirmed the United States' respect for the sovereignty of the DRC," in a phone call Monday with Tshisekedi.

A senior U.N. official in the Democratic Republic of Congo said Monday that fighting between the M23 rebels and the Congolese army in Goma is "not over yet," despite the rebel claims of control.

"Fighting is still very much ongoing," said Bruno Lemarquis, U.N. resident coordinator in the DRC. "It's a very, very fluid situation. It's a very dangerous situation."

He told reporters via a video call from DRC's capital, Kinshasha, that "active zones of combat have spread to all quarters" of Goma in North Kivu province. Lemarquis said there have been severe disruptions to water, electricity, internet and phone service. Humanitarian warehouses have been looted.

In early January, M23 rebels broke a ceasefire agreement, launching a large-scale offensive in the east with the support of the Rwandan army. The U.N. says the rebels have made significant territorial gains and are seeking to open a new front in neighboring South Kivu province.

The United Nations Security Council, Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and senior U.N. officials are calling for the M23 to immediately cease hostilities and withdraw from occupied territories. They have called for the withdrawal of Rwandan forces and a return to the Luanda process of mediation overseen by Angolan President João Lourenço.

"On behalf of the humanitarian community, I call on all parties to agree on temporary humanitarian pauses in the most affected areas and establish humanitarian corridors to ensure humanitarian activities resume at scale. And more importantly, also to facilitate the safe evacuation of wounded individuals and civilians trapped in combat zones," Lemarquis added.

The United Nations announced Sunday a $17 million disbursement from its central emergency fund for urgent humanitarian needs in DRC.

Lemarquis said nonessential U.N. staff, foreign and Congolese, are being temporarily evacuated from Goma to either Kinshasa or to a U.N. base in Entebbe in neighboring Uganda.

The U.N. peacekeeping mission, known by its acronym, MONUSCO, has also reinforced its positions to counter the rebels' advance on Goma, deploying a quick reaction force, a rapid deployment battalion, a reserve battalion, a platoon of special forces and an artillery battery.

"At this critical juncture now, the onus really is and has to be about bringing about an immediate cessation of hostilities," U.N. peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix told reporters on the same video call, speaking from Damascus, Syria, where he is on a mission.

"The fate of the millions of civilians living in Goma or having been displaced is really the priority, along with the safety and security of U.N. personnel," he said.

In the past few days, three U.N. peacekeepers have been killed and several injured in the conflict.

Before the latest round of violence, eastern DRC was already mired in one of the largest and most protracted humanitarian crises in the world, with nearly 6.5 million people displaced due to efforts by armed groups to seize control of the country's valuable mineral deposits.

Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, at a briefing in Goma on Thursday, said they plan to take their offensive all the way to the capital, Kinshasa.

The group captured the key eastern Congolese city earlier this week.

They also said they were open to dialogue with the government as part of their plans to gain political power in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

“Our objective is Congo, we are fighting for Congo. We are not fighting for minerals, we are not fighting for anything [else],” said one of the political leaders of M23, Corneille Nangaa.

There are unconfirmed reports that the M23 rebels are currently advancing towards Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the region, despite international calls for a ceasefire.

Nangaa said the rebel group was continuing the fight for three reasons.

“The first that there is not a state in DRC. The Tshisekedi regime has destroyed the army, destroyed the national police. He has destroyed administration and, above all, he has destroyed justice.''

The group’s announcement came hours after President Felix Tshisekedi called for a massive military mobilisation to resist the rebellion.

"I encourage him [Tshisekedi] to continue fighting, but we are going to fight him until we get to Kinshasa," said Nangaa.

He gave no indication as to how the rebels planned to advance on the capital which is more than 1,500 kilometres away.

The M23 called on residents of Goma to go about their daily life while the rebels work on facilitating much-needed humanitarian assistance.

The United Nations humanitarian coordinator in the DRC said basic services were largely paralysed in the city.

Goma is a critical humanitarian hub for more than six million people displaced by the conflict.

United Nations experts say the rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighbouring Rwanda.

They are one of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo’s mineral-rich east for the past decade.

Nangaa dismissed suggestions that it was a battle for resources as "propaganda from Kinshasa," insisting "our struggle is to restore this state, to give food to people".

He said the rebels' aim was "to start development, to make people live peacefully together, but also to create opportunity for the region and for the whole world."

Rwanda-backed rebels have claimed control of eastern Congo’s strategic city of Goma, the hub of a region containing trillions of dollars in mineral wealth that remains largely untapped.

It marks a sharp escalation in one of Africa’s longest wars, threatening to dramatically worsen a dire humanitarian crisis.

On Tuesday, U.N. officials reported bodies lying in the streets, widespread looting and outages of electricity, water and internet access. More than 2 million of Goma's civilian residents, including one million already displaced by the violence, were at risk of “catastrophic” humanitarian consequences, aid groups said.

Analysts said the M23 fighters aimed to control the city of about 2 million people and perhaps other areas in the region nearly 1,000 miles from the Congolese capital.

The rebels' offensive has sent hundreds of thousands fleeing their homes, in addition to 1 million displaced who are already in Goma, and stretched hospitals to the limit, with hundreds of wounded coming in every day as civilians get caught in the crossfire.

Here is what to know about the conflict:

Who are the rebels and what do they want?

The M23 group is one of about 100 armed factions vying for a foothold in eastern Congo, where a decades-long conflict has raged. The group, made up primarily of ethnic Tutsis who failed to integrate into the Congolese army, led a failed insurgency against the Congolese government in 2012. It was then dormant for a decade, until its resurgence in 2022.

Between 1996 and 2003, the region was at the heart of a protracted conflict dubbed “Africa’s world war,” as armed groups fought over access to metals and rare earth minerals such as copper, cobalt, lithium and gold. Up to 6 million people died.

The conflict can be traced to the aftermath of the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda, where Hutu militias killed between 500,000 and 1 million ethnic Tutsi, as well as moderate Hutus and Twa, Indigenous people.

When Tutsi-led forces fought back, nearly 2 million Hutus crossed into Congo, fearing reprisals. Tensions between Hutus and Tutsis have repeatedly flared in Congo since then.

Rwandan authorities have accused the Hutus who fled of participating in the genocide and alleged that elements of the Congolese army protected them. They have argued that the militias formed by a small fraction of the Hutus are a threat to Rwanda’s Tutsi population.

M23 claims to defend Tutsi and Congolese of Rwandan origin from discrimination. Critics say it’s a pretext for Rwanda to obtain economic and political influence over eastern Congo.

Why is control of eastern Congo so important?

As the world relies more than ever on Congo’s metals and rare earth minerals to produce electronics, the stakes have risen. Neighboring Rwanda and Uganda have financial interests in Congolese mines, as well as China and the United States.

Most of Congo’s mineral resources, estimated to be worth $24 trillion, remain untapped, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce last year, which called the country the world’s leading producer of cobalt, key to making batteries.

Little of the region’s wealth has trickled down to Congolese citizens, with 60% out of its 100 million residents living below the poverty line. Instead, fighting over natural resources has destabilized the country.

What’s the role of neighboring Rwanda?

Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing the M23, which had hundreds of members in 2021. Now, according to the United Nations, the group has around 6,500 fighters.

While Rwanda denies that claim, it acknowledged last year that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo, allegedly to safeguard its security. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo.

Analysts say that Rwandan troops in eastern Congo have been increasingly active in recent weeks.

Why is Goma important for the rebels?

The city is a regional hub for trade, security and humanitarian efforts, and its airport is key for transporting supplies.

Since 2021, Congo’s government and allied forces, including Burundian troops and U.N. troops, have been keeping the rebels away from Goma.

The capture of such a large city will be a huge boost for the rebels and a major defeat for government forces.

Goma's fall would also have a “catastrophic impact on hundreds of thousands of civilians, putting them at risk of heightened exposure to human rights violations and abuses,” said Ravina Shamdasani of the U.N. human rights office.

Is this likely to resolve like the last time?

In 2012, the rebels seized Goma and controlled it for about a week but surrendered the city after mounting international pressure on Rwanda — including suspension of aid from the United States and Britain.

But analysts say this time around, it will be more difficult.

“Previously, they (M23) had clear demands to be integrated into the DRC army and have greater participation in the political process,” said Darren Davids, an analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit. But now, he said, “it seems like M23, with the help of Rwanda, are intent on holding control of Goma and, more specifically, the supply chain routes in North Kivu.”

The rebels could use Goma as a bargaining chip, strengthening their position in possible negotiations with Congo.

What is the situation for civilians?

There are 4 million displaced people in eastern Congo, and the rebels’ escalated offensive sent additional hundreds of thousands fleeing their homes and displacement camps in recent weeks.

About 300,000 people sheltering in camps on Goma’s outskirts fled into the city as front lines moved over the weekend, only to find themselves trapped by the violence once again as rebels entered the city, according to the U.N.

The airport closed, roads were blocked, and aid groups said they were unable to provide lifesaving support to those in need. Medical facilities are at double their capacity. The main hospital in Goma treating the wounded, run by the International Committee of the Red Cross, is stretched beyond its limits, with tents set up in its courtyard to accommodate civilians wounded by bullets and heavy artillery.

Some civilians, desperate to flee the fighting, crossed into Rwanda to seek safety. More than 1,000 Congolese have been registered since Monday, according to Rwandan authorities.

The M23 rebel group has said that it would observe a ceasefire starting February 4, a week after it seized eastern Congo's Goma. UN agencies said that at least 900 people were killed in last week's fighting.

The alliance of rebel groups that captured the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC) strategic eastern city of Goma have declared a ceasefire in the region for humanitarian reasons.

The pause in the rebels' fight with the Congolese army — slated to begin on Tuesday — comes after hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and amid mounting calls for a safe passage of aid.

It also comes as the United Nations' Human Rights Council prepares to hold an emergency session on the situation in Goma, based on a request from Kinshasa.

Rebel alliance includes M23

The group called the Congo River Alliance also includes the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, who were reported to be gaining territory in other eastern parts of the country while advancing on South Kivu's provincial capital, Bukavu.

However, the rebel alliance said in its statement on Monday that it had no intention of seizing Bukavu.

"It must be made clear that we have no intention of capturing Bukavu or other areas. However, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions," M23 rebel spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said.

There was no immediate statement from Congo's government.

Last week, Congo River Alliance leader Corneille Nangaa said the militias would march "all the way to Kinshasa."

Hundreds dead in Goma

On Monday, UN agencies said that at least 900 people had been killed in last week's fighting in Goma.

The figure was presented by the UN's humanitarian affairs agency (OCHA), citing the World Health Organization (WHO).

The M23 rebel group captured Goma, which is Congo's largest city in the east and a major hub for humanitarian operations, on January 27.

According to UN experts, the M23 rebels are backed by nearly 4,000 soldiers from neighboring Rwanda.

The escalation has ignited fears of the conflict between 1996 and 2003 that left millions dead, mostly from hunger and disease.

DR congo requests emergency UNHRC session

The Democratic Republic of Congo meanwhile requested an emergency session of the United Nations Human Rights Council to address the situation in Goma.

A UN spokesperson said the session was requested to take place on February 7 in Geneva.

The UNHRC said it would hold the urgent session on Friday. The session is due to focus on "the human rights situation in eastern DRC," the French AFP news agency quoted council spokesman Pascal Sim as saying.

Long-running conflict

The roots of the conflict in Congo lie in part in decades-long ethnic strife.

M23 says it is defending the ethnic Tutsis in the country against ethnic Hutu militias like the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which was founded by Hutus who fled to Congo from Rwanda after taking part in the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

Rwanda alleges that the FDLR is "fully integrated" into the Congolese military but Congo denies the charges.

Kinshasa in turn accuses Rwanda of using M23 to take control of mineral-rich areas in eastern Congo.

Authorities in Congo have previously said that they are open to dialogue to find a solution for the long-running conflict, but the talks must be done within the framework of earlier peace agreements.

Rwanda and the rebel alliance accuse Congo of faltering on previous peace deals.

CNN —

A rebel group that claimed to have captured the city of Goma in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo last week has called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, after fighting with the Congolese military has left hundreds of people dead.

In a statement on Monday, the rebel coalition, Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) – which includes the M23 armed group – said it had declared the truce, starting Tuesday, “in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by the Kinshasa regime,” referring to DR Congo’s government.

The DRC and much of the international community have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels.

It is unclear if the Congolese army will agree to the ceasefire. Previous interventions, including truce agreements, failed to cease hostilities.

DR Congo’s military spokesperson, General Sylvain Ekenge, told CNN Tuesday that the rebels’ call for a ceasefire was not genuine.

“Have you seen the Rwandans do what they say? It (the ceasefire announcement by the rebels) is a communication for international consumption and to put the international community to sleep on its feet,” he said.

United Nations experts also estimate that up to 3,000-4,000 Rwandan soldiers are supervising and supporting M23 fighters in the east of the DRC, outnumbering the rebel group’s forces in the country.

Last week, DRC leader Felix Tshisekedi vowed “a vigorous and coordinated response” against M23, describing the group as Rwanda’s “puppet.”

On Monday, Rwandan President Paul Kagame told CNN he didn’t know if his country’s troops are in eastern DR Congo.

Fighting erupted last week as the rebels advanced into Goma, the capital of DRC’s North Kivu province.

More than a dozen foreign peacekeepers, as well as the military governor of North Kivu, were killed trying to fend off the rebels, and thousands of locals were displaced.

According to the UN’s latest figures, at least 900 bodies have been recovered from the streets of Goma, and around 2,880 injuries have been recorded since the end of January. A report by the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said many healthcare facilities are overcrowded and in urgent need of medicine and equipment.

The rebel alliance emphasized it has “no intention of capturing Bukavu or other areas,” referring to the capital city of the neighboring South Kivu province, where many displaced people from Goma had fled.

“However, we reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions,” it said.

The group’s recent communication appears to sharply shift its stance from capturing more territories. AFC spokesman, Victor Tesongo told CNN Friday that the rebels were working to “install a new administration” in Goma and further march on to capture more cities, including South Kivu and the national capital Kinshasa.

Rebel leader Corneille Nangaa also told Rwandan media last week that his group’s objective was “to go to Kinshasa.”

“We are going to fight until we get to Kinshasa. We have come to Goma to stay; we are not going to withdraw. We are going to move forward from Goma to Bukavu … up to Kinshasa,” he said.

At crisis talks in Harare, the Southern African Development Community reaffirmed its support of the Democratic Republic of the Congo's sovereignty. However, the escalating conflict weighs heavily on the wider region.

Days after the East African Community (EAC) met over the escalating conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), leaders from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) also held an extraordinary summit on Friday just outside Harare, Zimbabwe, to discuss the recent developments in the region.

"Escalating hostilities in eastern Congo have created a dire situation. We meet here to seek a lasting solution to end the challenges facing the DRC people," Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa said in his opening statement at the meeting.

"People in eastern Congo have suffered for far too long. While we pause to mourn our loss, our resolve to ensure collective security cannot be shaken."

Diplomatic stand-off between Rwanda and South Africa

The Zimbabwean leader, who is currently chairing the rotating leadership of SADC, confirmed the bloc's commitment to peace in the DRC while stressing how the conflict in the mineral-rich area had started to weigh heavily on diplomatic relations throughout the region.

This comes after 13 SADC troops from South Africa and three from Malawi were killed last week in clashes with fighters belonging to the March-23 (M23) movement.

Most governments throughout the region – including South Africa – but also many in the Global North believe that M23 is propped up and supplied with weapons by the Rwandan government – a charge which Kigali denies.

In the course of recent days, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, even appeared to be heading for a historic fall-out over this charge, with Ramaphosa demanding a ceasefire from Kagame's government and Kagame openly threatening South Africa with retaliation in response.

The Rwandan leader accused Ramaphosa of lying and distorting the facts on the ground, adding that "South Africa is in no position to take on the role of a peacemaker or mediator."

"And if South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day," Kagame's statement concluded.

Ramaphosa meanwhile stressed that "South Africa's military presence in the eastern DRC is not a declaration of war against any country or state," demanding "the reversal of territorial expansion by the M23" and "the exit of external forces from the DRC."

A conflict brewing for 150 years

Kagame, who has been leading Rwanda for 25 years, meanwhile is used to hearing a more accommodating rhetoric from the regional powerhouse, South Africa.

Former South African president Thabo Mbeki once urged the DRC not to treat M23 as invading foreigners from Rwanda but to listen actively to their grievances.

M23 consists mainly of members of a Tutsi clan, who were moved to the present-day DR Congo during the partition of Africa in the 1880s, while a large part of the clan went to present-day Rwanda.

With Tutsis also being the main victims of the 1994 Rwanda genocide, any criticism against the ethnic group is typically met with resentment by Kigali; Kagame himself is Tutsi.

While South African President Ramaphosa attended the meeting in Harare, DRC leader Felix Tshisekedi failed to pitch in person and was reportedly following the proceedings online, which may only have further fanned the flames of anger in Kigali.

A traumatized population

As hostilities appear to be mounting, experts are increasingly calling for unity and a peaceful end to the conflict. Numerous humanitarian organizations as well as several United Nations agencies have described the situation in areas around the city of Goma in the eastern DRC as "critical," with reports of citizens having to go for days without vital supplies.

Francis Akili, coordinator of the Kinshasa-based humanitarian NGO, Action Asante, told DW that everyone in the eastern DRC is affected by the recent escalation, especially those in the North Kivu province:

"As a humanitarian worker, I can confirm that the crisis has led to a severe lack of basic necessities such as water and electricity, exacerbating an already critical situation. This not only impacts daily survival but also creates a deep sense of fear and anxiety among the population, leading to widespread psychological distress."

At the same time, fighting between the DRC military and its allies and the M23 movement has also intensified once more in recent days, with M23 rebels declaring that they are hoping to march on Kinshasa and take over the government.

Displacement, rape and murder

Meanwhile, UN agencies confirm that large swathes of the local population continue to suffer multiple instances of trauma. Speaking from Geneva on Friday, United Nations Human Rights spokesperson Jeremy Laurence said that hostilities had expanded towards South Kivu following the M23 takeover of Goma.

"Reports indicate that M23 has progressed further south towards Bukavu. Since the start of the crisis, bombs have struck at least two IDP [internally displaced person] sites, causing civilian casualties," he said.

"We have also documented summary executions of at least 12 people by M23 between 26 and 28 January. Our Office has also documented cases of conflict-related sexual violence by the army and allied Wazalendo fighters in Kalehe territory. We are verifying reports that 52 women were raped by Congolese troops in South Kivu, including alleged reports of gang rape."

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk agreed in a statement that the latest escalation could result in a further spike of sexual violence being used as a weapon of war.

Talks only leading to further talks

Harare-based political analyst Dereck Goto told DW that the EAC and SADC needed to join forces to demand an end to the conflict in eastern Congo, since the DRC is a member of both organizations.

"That should also include asking Rwanda not to support M23 and fortifying governance structures in DRC so that it is able to reach out to people in Goma," he said.

Akili agrees that the EAC and SADC need to work together to push the warring parties to put down their arms, adding that the suffering has been made worse by thousands of people also being displaced due to the conflict since the beginning of the year in eastern Congo.

At the end of the summit, leaders agreed that they would indeed convene with the EAC as a matter of urgency in a bid to resolve the situation, though little more is known about the meeting at the present.

The UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) meanwhile confirmed that it continues to receive urgent requests from civilians for protection, and that it was working with other UN agencies and their partners to ensure their safety.

analysis

The crisis in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) escalated at the end of January 2025 when Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu, fell to Rwanda-backed M23 rebels.

The civilian population is paying a heavy price as a result of ongoing violence, despite a series of initiatives aimed at creating conditions for peace. Since the re-emergence of the M23 in November 2021, violent clashes with the Congolese army have led to thousands of deaths and displaced more than one million people in North Kivu province alone.

Patrick Hajayandi, whose research focuses on peacebuilding and regional reconciliation, examines previous attempts at finding peace in eastern DRC - and what needs to happen next.

What efforts have been made by the DRC and Rwanda to ease tensions?

The eastern DRC has become the site of renewed tensions between Kigali and Kinshasa. Rwanda lies to the east of the DRC. The two nations share a border of about 217 kilometres.

Kigali accuses the DRC of hosting the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, the largest illegal armed group operating in the conflict area. Better known by its French acronym, FDLR, the group has stated its intention to overthrow the Rwandan government.

On the other hand, Kinshasa accuses Rwanda of supporting and arming the M23, which seeks to control the two Kivu provinces, North and South. The involvement of the Rwandan Defence Forces in direct combat alongside the M23, corroborated by UN experts, has escalated the spread of violence.

Despite current tensions between Kinshasa and Kigali, a few years ago the two governments engaged in collaborative efforts to solve the problem posed by the numerous armed groups operating in eastern DRC.

Such efforts included two joint operations with Congolese and Rwandan forces aimed at neutralising the FDLR. These joint operations in 2008 and 2009 were known as Operation Kimia and Umoja Wetu. In 2019 and 2020, soon after he took power, President Felix Tshisekedi allowed the Rwandan army to conduct operations against the FDLR in Congolese territory.

However, in recent years, relations have soured badly between Kinshasa and Kigali. This has led to regional efforts to broker peace.

Why has it been so difficult for regional actors to broker peace in the DRC?

The first complicating factor relates to the different roles that regional actors play in the DRC.

The involvement of a multitude of countries points to the complexity underlying the conflict and the diverse geopolitical interests. The DRC shares a border with nine countries: Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

In 2022, the African Union asked Angolan president João Lourenço to mediate between the DRC and Rwanda. The process he oversees is known as the Luanda Process and seeks to defuse the escalation of violence across the region. In particular, it has sought to reduce tensions between Kigali and Kinshasa.

The East African Community is directly involved in peace initiatives to restore peace in DRC. It has appointed former Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta to lead what is called the Nairobi Process.

Read more: DRC-Rwanda crisis: what's needed to prevent a regional war

The DRC has rebuffed the East African Community's reconciliation efforts. And Rwanda recently criticised both processes, suggesting the country had lost confidence in the ability of Lourenço and Kenyatta to find a solution.

In May 2023, the Southern African Development Community, of which the DRC is a member state, deployed a peace mission. This followed the exit of troops from the East African Community.

Other countries play different roles directly or indirectly in various missions in the DRC. Burundi is supporting military operations there under the framework of bilateral agreements in the defence sector. Uganda also deployed troops, ostensibly in pursuit of jihadist-backed armed rebels three years ago. However, this deployment has been a destabilising factor, with Kampala facing accusations of supporting the M23.

What have been the main hurdles in the way of these initiatives?

The East African Community Regional Force was deployed to pursue peace in eastern DRC as part of the Nairobi Process. However, this mission was cut short due to four main challenges:

differences over mission objectives: the DRC government believed that the East African Community Regional Force would militarily confront M23 rebels. But the force had different objectives. As indicated by its commander, the deployment was to focus on overseeing the implementation of a political agreement, not run a military confrontation.

contrasting views among the leaders of the East African Community member states on how to address the DRC's crisis: the DRC and Rwanda are both members of the community. Rwanda is vocal about stopping the persecution of Congolese Tutsi in the DRC. However, there is a growing perception that Rwanda is supporting the M23 as a proxy force to allow it to control mineral resources. This has stalled reconciliation efforts.

a lack of financial support for the talks: the African Union and regional bodies don't have enough funding to support the interventions required to make meaningful progress.

The Luanda Process has not been able to bring tangible results either. The reasons for this failure include bad faith from the parties involved. This was reflected in the continued capture of territories by Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, despite a July 2024 ceasefire.

After the January 2025 seizure of Goma and wave of deaths and displacement that followed, the M23 declared another ceasefire. Whether it will hold remains to be seen.

Rwanda's behaviour in the ongoing conflict is complicating peace efforts. Kigali continues to deny supporting the M23 armed group. But it is participating in negotiations that involve the M23 and the DRC government. These contradictions make it difficult to know exactly who must be held responsible when, for example, a ceasefire is violated.

What's required to give peace in the DRC a chance?

The current peace initiatives have been ineffective; they are routinely violated. What is needed is real pressure on the actors involved in spreading violence, forcing them to halt their destructive activities.

Congolese Nobel Prize winner Denis Mukwege, for example, has called for diplomatic and economic measures to end the aggression in the DRC. This would mean implementing sanctions and aid conditionalities in both Kigali and Kinshasa against the military and political leaders orchestrating violence against civilian populations.

Interventions should also include addressing structural causes of the conflict in the DRC, including resource exploitation.

There is also a need to address impunity as an essential step towards lasting peace. Rwanda must not continue to support an armed group that is attacking a neighbour. Kigali needs to be held accountable. International pressure is essential in halting attacks. The DRC government must also play its role as a guarantor of security for all its citizens.

Allied Democratic Forces: The Ugandan rebels working with IS in DR Congo

13 June 2021 Share Save Linnete Bahati and Driss El-Bay BBC Monitoring Share Save

Getty Images ADF/IS attacks around Beni have become more frequent since March 2020

The eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo has long been a cradle of rebel activity, often the spill-over of conflict in neighbouring Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.

Among the most notorious groups now operating there is Uganda's Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).

The Islamist militant outfit was formed in the 1990s and primarily concerned itself with domestic grievances within Uganda.

But after re-emerging in DR Congo, its activity has taken on a more global jihadist dimension, with attacks increasingly being claimed in the name of the Islamic State (IS) group.

How did the ADF start?

The ADF was created in eastern Uganda and took up arms against long-serving President, Yoweri Museveni, alleging government persecution of Muslims.

Islamic State propaganda IS video of militants in the aftermath of an attack on a village in Ituri province

After its defeat by the Ugandan army in 2001, it relocated to North Kivu province in the DR Congo.

Following a period of low-level activity, the ADF re-emerged in 2014 with a series of attacks on Congolese civilians.

Musa Seka Baluku became leader in 2015 following the arrest of his predecessor Jamil Mukulu.

Baluku reportedly first pledged allegiance to IS in 2016.

But it was not until April 2019 that IS first acknowledged its activity in the area, when it claimed an attack on army positions near the border with Uganda.

This statement marked the announcement of IS's "Central Africa Province" (Iscap), which would later include Mozambique.

While there are indications that IS has co-opted the ADF, IS has never publicly mentioned it by name in its propaganda.

In September 2020, Baluku claimed that the ADF had "ceased to exist".

"At present, we are a province, the Central African Province, which is one of many provinces that make up the Islamic State," he said.

Local media still attribute attacks to the ADF.

What is the situation in DR Congo?

According to the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, the ADF has killed about 200 civilians and displaced nearly 40,000 others in Beni since January 2021. The rebel group also targets government and UN troops.

Since the emergence of IS in DR Congo, the frequency of attacks has increased.

Iscap's attacks take place in ADF territory, centring on North Kivu's Beni territory, with occasional forays into neighbouring Ituri Province.

BBC Monitoring ADF activity mainly centres on Beni in Nord Kivu

The vast majority of these are on military targets, but the deadliest attacks are on Christian civilians.

Iscap's most significant attack so far appears to have been the October 2020 jail break in Beni that led to the escape of over 1,000 prisoners.

Fears of religious conflict

The conflict in eastern DR Congo has often touched off ethnic tensions, but the involvement of IS risks adding a sectarian dynamic.

DR Congo is predominantly Roman Catholic, and the church is a key player in the country. Muslims comprise about 10% of the population.

The Muslim community in Beni has become increasingly vocal against the rebel group, but this comes at a cost.

In May, two prominent clerics known to be critical of the ADF were shot dead in Beni.

The rebel group has also been linked to attacks against Catholics. In October 2012, it abducted three Catholic priests from a convent in the Mbau locality. Their whereabouts remain unknown.

In its propaganda, IS has frequently singled out Christians and taunted the DR Congo government over its "failure" to protect them from its attacks.

Such provocation is characteristic of IS, which often seeks to exacerbate local tensions to bolster its credentials as a defender of ordinary Muslims against "oppression".

IS propaganda

The ADF does not appear to run its own media outlets or to independently claim responsibility for attacks.

But IS has a sophisticated and centralised online media operation at its disposal, bolstered by a host of supportive outlets operating on various messaging platforms.

Islamic State propaganda Iscap propaganda has included images of children

The bulk of Iscap propaganda consists of written claims of attacks, and photos of their aftermath.

In March, as a show of force, Iscap released images purporting to show its militants roaming the streets of a village in Ituri province following an attack on the army. But such images are rare and suggest that IS has yet to become a significant force in DR Congo.

In October 2020, IS's flagship newspaper al-Naba released a special infographic flaunting Iscap operations over a period of 12 months, highlighting attacks in both DR Congo and Mozambique.

Regional jihadist expansion

Rebel violence in eastern DR Congo has largely been sustained by a lack of strong government institutions and mistrust in military intervention.

These are ideal conditions in which IS can expand, as evidenced by its surge across Iraq and Syria in 2014, and more recently in West Africa, where it has spread beyond north-east Nigeria into the Sahel region.

Similarly, IS expansion is often driven by alliances or the co-opting of established local groups with a shared ideology, as appears to have happened with the ADF.

Iscap is likely to exploit the increased violence to expand activity in neighbouring countries.

Indeed this is already in evidence, with increased attacks in Mozambique and the first Iscap-claimed attack in Tanzania in October last year, which reportedly left 20 soldiers dead.

Ugandan author of The Greedy Barbarian charged over Museveni tweets

11 January 2022 Share Save Share Save

PEN Pinter Prize Kakwenza Rukirabashaija, who is best known for The Greedy Barbarian, won a prestigious prize last year for courageous writing

Award-winning Ugandan author Kakwenza Rukirabashaija has been charged with two counts of "offensive communication" after making unflattering remarks about the president and his son on Twitter.

The prosecution alleged that he had "used his Twitter handle to disturb the peace" of President Yoweri Museveni and his son Lt-Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba.

Mr Rukirabashaija pleaded not guilty to the charges, local media report.

He had tweeted that Lt-Gen Muhoozi was "obese" and a "curmudgeon".

The author had also tweeted that "the Musevenis have imposed enormous suffering on this country".

President Museveni, 77, has been in power in Uganda since 1986, and there has long been speculation that he was grooming his son - a powerful figure in the military - to succeed him.

Kakwenza Rukirabashaija is best known for The Greedy Barbarian, a satirical novel which describes high-level corruption in a fictional country, and Banana Republic: Where Writing is Treasonous, an account of the torture he was subjected to while in detention in 2020.

Last year, he won the Pen Pinter Prize for an international writer of courage.

Local opposition parties and civil society groups - along with the United States and the European Union - have been calling for the writer's release since his detention on 28 December.

On Tuesday, Mr Rukirabashaija appeared in court in the capital, Kampala, for the first time since he was detained.

His lawyer, Eron Kiiza, told the magistrate that the 33-year-old author's health was failing.

Mr Kiiza had previously alleged that Mr Rukirabashaija had been tortured in detention.

The author has been charged with two counts of "offensive communication" under the Computer Misuse Act.

The prosecution alleged that Mr Rukirabashaija had "wilfully and repeatedly used his Twitter handle to disturb the peace of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Uganda, Gen Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, with no purpose of legitimate communication".

He is facing a similar charge in relation to the president's son.

If convicted, Mr Rukirabashaija could be imprisoned for up to a year, according to Reuters news agency.

Rwandan-backed rebels gained ground in eastern Congo on Wednesday despite the unilateral ceasefire they declared earlier this week, taking control of a city 60 miles (96 kilometers) from the provincial capital of Bukavu, civil society officials and residents told the press.

Speaking from Goma, the U.N's deputy head of its mission there said the situation remains highly volatile, with a persistent risk of escalation.

The M23 rebels on Monday announced the ceasefire on humanitarian grounds after pleas for the safe passage of aid and hundreds of thousands of displaced people.

But Congo's government has described the ceasefire as “false communication," and the United Nations has noted reports of heavy fighting with Congolese forces in the mineral-rich region.

After seizing control of Goma, a provincial capital of 2 million people at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth, the rebels were reported to be gaining ground in other areas of eastern Congo and advancing on Bukavu.

The rebels on Monday said they did not intend to seize Bukavu or other areas, though they earlier expressed ambition to march on Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, a thousand miles away.

The active and illegal foreign armed groups operating on the soil of the DR Congo include the following:

The Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) is the largest illegal foreign armed group operating in the DR Congo. While there is currently a growing number of Congolese among their ranks, the group is primarily formed from members of the Rwandan government and army ousted in 1994 as well as Rwandan refugees. Its public purpose is to use military pressure to open "inter-Rwandan dialogue" with the current Rwandan government, but its covert purpose appears to be to overthrow the Rwandan government. The FDLR currently operates in eastern DR Congo and Katanga province. Its current strength is estimated to be 2000 combatants. It can be recalled that in 2009, a joint operation was mounted against the FDLR by FARDC, the Rwandan Army (RDF), and MONUSCO.

The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) is a Ugandan rebel group based along the Rwenzori Mountains of eastern DR Congo. Most of its members are Islamists who want to establish Shari'a law in Uganda. The ADF was formed around 1998 by a merger of various streams of discontented sectors of Ugandan society which felt alienated after the overthrow of Idi Amin. The group appears to be receiving external funding from unknown sources. In June 2010, the FARDC launched an attack called “operation Ruwenzori” against the ADF. The ADF currently number approximately 500 combatants but the high level of secrecy in the organization and its compartmentalized structure make it difficult to ascertain its overall strength. Since 2001, the Uganda government offered Amnesty and Reinsertion program to all members of the ADF.

The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is a Ugandan rebel group currently based along the northern border areas of Congo as well as in the eastern Central African Republic. The LRA was created in 1997 by remnants of the Ugandan spiritual rebel movement under Alice Lakwena and the remnants of the Ugandan army overthrown by President Yuweri Museveni. The group was formed primarily by individuals from the Acholi tribe in Northern Uganda. Between 1994 and 2004, the LRA was based in Southern Sudan but after the peace negotiations that led to the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) taking over control of Southern Sudan the group moved its base to DRC. This was in September 2005. The LRA remained relatively quiet in the DRC until it began a violent expansion campaign in September 2008. This campaign forced the armies of the DRC, Uganda and the SPLA IN Southern Sudan to launch a joint military operation against them in December 2008. The LRA is made up of hard core Ugandan combatants as well as recruits forcefully abducted from the DRC, South Sudan and the Central African Republic.

The National Liberation Forces (FNL) is a Burundian rebel group originally formed in 1985 as the military wing of a Hutu-led rebel group called the PALIPEHUTU. Both the PALIPEHUTU and the FNL signed a peace agreement in September 2006 and became simply FNL. While most of the FNL integrated into the national Burundian army after the elections in mid 2010 the remnants restarted rebel activities. They later started infiltrating the Ruzizi plains and Lake Tanganyika and crossed into South Kivu where they created rear bases to fight the Burundian armed forces. The FNL currently appears to be in an alliance with Mai Mai Yakutumba and FDLR in South Kivu.

Since 2002 to July 2013, the DDRRR Section repatriated more than 29,000 foreign ex-combatants and their dependants. The Section has 18 sites in North Kivu, South Kivu, Oriental Province and North Katanga. It also runs four rapid response mobile teams capable of a rapid responding for any emergency throughout their operational areas. The DDRRR Section has visible presence in most parts of eastern DR Congo and that enables it to facilitate the transportation of Rwandan refugees thereby complimenting the work of the United nations High Commission for Refugees, (UNHCR.)

Over the past nine months, 33 Congolese fishermen have been killed and 56 others injured on Lake Kivu, allegedly by soldiers suspected to belong to the Rwandan naval force. The attacks occurred during nighttime fishing activities, according to local sources.

The grim statistics were revealed by the Synergy of Lake Kivu Fishermen's Associations in a recent meeting with provincial authorities, where they appealed for protection from ongoing violence.

One fisherman, Mushagalusa Salomon, has narrowly escaped his attackers four times, but each time his fishing nets and boat were taken by the assailants.

"Sometimes they arrive in groups of nine in a boat and start throwing stones at us. We have to jump into the water, and that's when they take our belongings. If you don't jump, they kill you and take everything," Salomon explained.

Lake Kivu is a vital source of livelihood for many families in the region, including those from the territories surrounding the lake and the city of Bukavu. Fish caught from the lake are a staple in local markets, serving as a key food source for the community.

In an effort to halt the violence, the General Directorate of Migration (DGM) has pledged to provide two speedboats for enhanced security patrols on Lake Kivu.

Provincial deputy Jackson Kalimba, who has investigated the attacks on fishermen, vowed to use his influence to press authorities in Kinshasa to take action.

"More than 34 fishermen have been killed, and 56 others severely injured. As elected representatives, we are urging both provincial and national authorities to boost security on Lake Kivu to ensure that fishermen are protected by the Congolese state," Kalimba said.

At a public accountability meeting held on September 8, South Kivu Governor Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki announced plans to install surveillance cameras on Lake Kivu to monitor the situation and prevent further incidents.

Attempts to obtain a response from the Rwandan naval forces were unsuccessful, as tensions between the two countries continue to strain diplomatic relations.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) vowed to sue Rwanda at the East African Court of Justice in Arusha on September 26.

The DRC accuses Rwanda of violating its sovereignty, committing atrocities against civilians, and breaking international law in the ongoing conflict in eastern Congo.

Tshisekedi, along with U.S. and U.N. experts, accuse neighboring Rwanda of giving military backing to M23.

Rwanda denies the claim, but in February it effectively admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border.

This legal action follows efforts by Congolese Deputy Minister of Justice Samuel Mbemba, who pressured the court to take up the case. Rwanda is also facing charges before the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights.

The DRC is pushing for accountability and urging the International Criminal Court (ICC) to speed up its investigation into Rwanda's actions. The government has launched a "Justice for the DRC" campaign to raise awareness and demand justice for the victims.

Eastern Congo has struggled with armed violence as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources, while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings.

The violence concentrated in the eastern North Kivu province has resulted not just in arbitrary killings but also in sexual abuses.

Thousands of people are fleeing their homes in the towns and villages surrounding Goma as clashes between the Congolese army and M23 rebels escalate, seeking refuge in the bustling city, where the conflict has also reached unsettling proportions.

Goma, the largest town in the area and home to a significant Congolese army presence, has become the focal point of this mass exodus. Residents of neighboring villages, like Olive Luanda from Sake, recount harrowing scenes of soldiers abandoning their posts, prompting civilians to flee in fear of the advancing M23 fighters.

"Soldiers warned us that the M23 rebels were advancing, and we had no choice but to flee," shared Luanda, highlighting the sudden and desperate nature of the displacement.

Despite the arduous journey to Goma, which can take up to five hours on foot from Sake, the safety of the city is far from guaranteed. Recent days have seen rockets raining down on the city's outskirts, albeit causing no casualties, underscoring the indiscriminate nature of the conflict's reach.

Alain Bauma, a 29-year-old resident forced to abandon his home in Sake, encapsulated the profound sense of uncertainty and displacement gripping the fleeing population. "We fled Sake because we fear for our lives," he expressed, laden with his belongings as he sought refuge in Goma. "The city is under attack, and we are left with nowhere to go."

The inability of Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi to quell the violence despite his reelection in December has raised doubts about the government's capacity to restore peace. Analysts point to Tshisekedi's ongoing struggle to fulfill promises of stability in the region, exacerbating the plight of civilians caught in the crossfire.

Accusations levelled against Rwanda for providing military support to the M23 rebels further complicate the situation, with the United Nations echoing Tshisekedi's claims, despite Rwanda's vehement denial.

As the conflict escalates and displacement surges, the future remains uncertain for the people of Goma and its surrounding areas, trapped in a cycle of violence with no end in sight.

KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — A rebel group with alleged links to Rwanda this week seized Rubaya, a mining town in eastern Congo known for producing a key mineral used in smartphones, the group said Thursday in a statement.

In a statement shared with The Associated Press, a spokesperson for the M23 rebel group said the town was “liberated.”

The Congolese army declined to comment on the situation.

The decadeslong conflict in eastern Congo has produced one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with over 100 armed groups fighting for control of the mineral-rich area near the border with Rwanda. Many groups are accused of carrying out mass killings, rapes and other human rights violations. The violence has displaced about 7 million people, many beyond the reach of aid.

The town of Rubaya holds deposits of tantalum, which is extracted from coltan, a key component in the production of smartphones. It is among the minerals that was named earlier this month in a letter from Congo’s government questioning Apple about the tech company’s knowledge of “blood minerals” being smuggled in its supply chain.

“The fall of Rubaya is in a way the embodiment of this systemic plundering,” Ernest Singoma, a civil society activist in Goma, told the AP on Thursday.

There’s been an upsurge in fighting in recent months between M23 rebels and Congo army forces, and it comes as the United Nations plans to withdraw peacekeepers from the region by the end of the year.

John Banyene, a civil society activist, told the AP that the rebels were advancing towards the town of Goma, which is eastern Congo’s largest city and the capital of North Kivu province.

“All the supply routes to the city are blocked,” said Banyene.“We are just getting by.”

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi alleges Rwanda is destabilizing Congo by backing the M23 rebels. U.N. experts, along with the U.S. State Department, have also accused Rwanda of backing the rebels. Rwanda denies the claims.

Earlier this week, French President Emmanuel Macron called on neighboring Rwanda to halt its support for the M23 rebel group during a joint press conference with Tshisekedi in Paris.

Onesphore Sematumba, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, said the capture of Rubaya was a significant development in the conflict.

“Rubaya has mining deposits and without doubt this will allow M23 to exploit them,” he told the AP.

The March 23 Movement, or M23, is a rebel military group mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis that broke away from the Congolese army just over a decade ago. They staged a large offensive in 2012 and took over the provincial capital of Goma near the border with Rwanda, the same city they are threatening again.

The army of the Democratic Republic of Congo has announced that it wants to arrest and punish "any soldier" in contact with militiamen of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), citing "zero tolerance" for offenders.

The FDLR is an armed group created by former senior officials of the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda in 1994, refugees in eastern DRC after their debacle the same year.

The group has been under sanction by the United Nations Security Council since 2012. Its fighters are accused of numerous murders, mutilations, rapes, forced population displacements, and recruitment of children.

The FARDC (Armed Forces of the DRC) have been accused since mid-2022 of collaborating with the FDLR, mainly Hutu, to stem the advance of the M23 rebels, led by Tutsi, in the province of North Kivu.

In a video statement released Tuesday evening, the spokesperson for the Congolese army, General Sylvain Ekenge, proclaimed a "strict and unfailing ban" for all soldiers, "regardless of their rank", from "tying or to maintain any contact" with FDLR militiamen. “Any offender” will be “arrested and will suffer the rigor of the law,” he declared.

According to independent UN experts, Congolese soldiers have cooperated with FDLR fighters against the M23 since the return of the rebellion at the end of 2021. It has since seized entire swaths of North Kivu, a province bordering Rwanda and Uganda, causing, according to the UN, the flight of more than a million people.

The M23 is supported in men and weapons by Rwanda, according to UN experts. On numerous occasions, the Rwandan government has denounced the collaboration between the FARDC and the FDLR, which it describes as a threat to its security.

At the end of October, an AFP team witnessed collaborations between Congolese soldiers and FDLR fighters in the town of Bambo in North Kivu, as the M23 attacked the town.

The Congolese army's statement prohibiting cooperation with the FDLR follows a recent visit to the DRC and Rwanda by the head of American intelligence, Avril Haines.

The White House said Tuesday it had secured a promise from the leaders of both countries to de-escalate tensions.

Families of the victims of last week's bomb attacks in eastern Congo mourned their loved ones at a ceremony in Goma.

The bombings at Mugunga and Lac Vert camps killed 18 and injured 32. The type of explosives used remains unclear. Most victims were women and children.

Eye witness

Alimeti Kigiho, who survived the attack, had sought shelter from eastern Congo's long war at the Mugunga displacement camp in February, only to be shaken by explosions while going to fetch water.

He ran back to his tent, where he found the bodies of his wife and two young children, aged 6 and 2, in pieces.

"War has taken everything from me," Kigiho, 45, told the Associated Press.

Who is to blame?

The Congolese army and a rebel group known as M23 have blamed each other for the bombings. The March 23 Movement, or M23, is a rebel military group mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis that broke away from the Congolese army 12 years ago.

The decades-long conflict in eastern Congo has produced one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with over 100 armed groups fighting in the region, most for land and control of mines with valuable minerals.

Some are fighting to try to protect their communities. Many groups are accused of carrying out mass killings, rapes and other human rights violations.

Accusations

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi accuses neighbouring Rwanda of destabilizing Congo by backing the M23 rebels. U.N. experts, along with the U.S. State Department, have also accused Rwanda of backing the rebels. Rwanda denies the claims.

Some of the mourners at the ceremony on Monday criticized President Tshisekedi along with the international community for failing to end the long-running conflict.

"If he is unable to end this war, he should resign," Bienfait Bonane, a youth from Goma, told the Associated Press.

The violence has displaced about 7 million people, including thousands living in temporary camps like the ones attacked last week. Many others are beyond the reach of aid.

The attacks have driven some residents in the camp to consider returning to their homes, despite the dangers that caused them to flee in the first place.

After nearly two decades in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the United Nations stabilisation mission in Congo (MONUSCO) has signed a deal to withdraw its 15,000 peacekeepers.

The Congolese foreign minister Christophe Lutundula and MONUSCO's head signed the agreements on Tuesday.

Speaking on national television, Lutundula said the deal marked the end of a collaboration "which has proved its limits in a context of permanent war, without the longed for peace being restored to eastern Congo."

Violence in eastern Congo

Eastern Congo is in the grip of a decades-long conflict fought by dozens of armed groups, some backed by DRC's neighbours.

With presidential and parliamentary elections coming up on December 20, the conflict has taken centre stage.

In September, incumbent President Félix Tshisekedi called for an accelerated withdrawal of the UN peacekeepers.

The UN mission in the region has often caused tensions amongst the local population, with protests against MONUSCO and others at times turning deadly.

At the end of August, a crackdown by Congolese troops on anti-UN demonstrations resulted in nearly 50 deaths.

Failed missions

With the Congolese frustrated at what they feel to be a lack of protection from the rebel groups, the Congolese government last month also directed the East African regional force to leave the country by December.

The force, composed of troops from Burundi, Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda, has been deployed in the area since late 2022 to help end the fighting. The government alleges a "lack of satisfactory results on the ground".

The withdrawal of MONUSCO's forces was not given a firm timeline in Tuesday's announcement, with observers saying that any acceleration is unlikely before the end of the current election cycle.

The Democratic Republic of Congo once again accuses Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebels.

Tuesday, October 24, in a tweet, government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya published some drone images, which appear to indicate incursions by the Rwandan armed forces into the city of Tongo and Rutshuru in North Kivu, in the east of the DRC to support elements of the M23.

The M23 rebels seized swaths of territory last year which they continue to occupy in the province of North Kivu. Kinshasa criticizes Kigali for its support for this predominantly Tutsi rebellion, Kigali in return accusing Kinshasa of collusion with the FDLR, an armed group of Rwandan Hutu origin.

These areas have experienced an upsurge in violence since October 1, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA. Nearly 85,000 people had to flee various localities to find refuge, particularly in places like Mweso, Nyanzale, Kitshanga, Kalemba, Pinga, Kibachiro, Kahira, Ngingwe, Kyatembe and other localities located in Masisi territory.

For the government spokesperson, this presence of the RDF favored the massacres of the populations in the villages of Ruzenze, Bishishe, Marangara. On October 18, 2023 in Kinshasa, President Félix Tshisekedi meeting with senior officers of the Congolese army reiterated his determination to put an end to the M23 movement and its allies militarily.

The UN recently expressed concern about a risk of “direct confrontation” between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, at loggerheads since the reappearance at the end of 2021 in eastern Congo of the M23 rebellion.

The 2018 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Dr. Denis Mukwege, said he had received $100,000 from his supporters for a possible candidacy in the December 20 presidential elections in the DR Congo.

Members of civil society (women's associations, local organizations, trade unions) flocked to his hospital in Bukavu, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, to present him with a check for the amount of the deposit required to run for president.

For almost 30 years, the region has been plagued by armed group violence, mass rape and genital mutilation.

The 68-year-old Denis Mukwege who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of women who have been raped, has not confirmed whether he will stand as a candidate.

One of the most outspoken critics of President Félix Tshisekedi's regime, Dr. Mukwege once again vilified the head of the state's diplomacy, criticizing him in particular for having called on East African armies to confront the "war on terror".

The single-round presidential election is scheduled for December 20.

Tshisekedi, who has been president since January 2019, is running for a second five-year term.

Possible candidates have until October 8 to register.

The political climate is tense with three months to go to the polls. Prosecutions and arrests of opposition members and journalists are multiplying across the country.

At least three journalists have been arrested or detained in recent days.

Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, the facilitator of the peace talks in eastern DR Congo, held a meeting on Wednesday in Goma, in the heart of the conflict zone, at the end of which he reiterated a call to a "peaceful resolution" of the crisis.

"We are not here to open new negotiations," he told the press, after meeting in the capital of North Kivu with the Congolese authorities, representatives of the United Nations, and Western diplomats.

The commanders of the M23, a mainly Tutsi rebellion that has seized large swathes of territory in this province bordering Rwanda and Uganda since last year, are demanding talks with the government as a prerequisite for their surrender.

The Congolese authorities declare for their part that they refuse any dialogue with the M23, demanding the disarmament and cantonment of its troops without conditions and the withdrawal of the Rwandan army.

The former Kenyan president called for the various regional peace initiatives to be pursued, so that "the Congolese are able to talk to each other to resolve the problems of this great nation".

He also insisted on the return of the two million people displaced by the conflict and called for the DRC to be "respected as a sovereign and united country".

The governor of North Kivu, General Constant Ndima, denounced the presence of Rwandan troops in North Kivu, calling it a "useless war of aggression".

On 7 July, the European Union reiterated "its urgent request" to Rwanda to "withdraw its troops from eastern DRC" and "immediately end all support for M23".

The governor expressed his "deep gratitude for the establishment of the force" of the East African Community (EAC), which provides a buffer zone between the M23 and the Rwandan army on the one hand, and the FARDC (armed forces of the DRC) and militias on the other, some of which, like the FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda), are supported by the Congolese army.

The EAC force, which includes Kenyan, Ugandan, Burundian, and South Sudanese contingents, was criticised in May by Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi for cohabiting with the "M23 terrorists" and suggested that it would have to leave the country at the end of June if its "mandate is not fulfilled".

Despite the absence of major developments in areas under M23 and EAC control, and sporadic clashes since early July, the presence of a regional force in eastern DRC has been extended until September.

Vatican envoy, Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, appealed for peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo during a visit to the Bushagara camp in the east of the country. His visit came one day after the killing of more than 45 people, including 23 children, in the camp.

An envoy for the Vatican called on authorities in the DRC and the international community to build peace in the country suffering decades of violence.

The appeal, during a visit on Tuesday, followed the killing of more than 45 people, including 23 children, in a displaced camp in the east of the country.

“In the name of the millions of migrants forced and refugees that move in various parts of the world we appeal to the goodwill of people and especially to those who have a position of authority in the country and in the international world, to build peace”, said Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle, envoy of the Pope to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

More than 120 armed groups, namely the M23 rebel movement, are fighting in the region.

"We are asking our government and the Pope in Rome to help us so the M23 issue can be solved, and we can return home because we need peace" pleaded Safari Nyundi, a displaced person.

The attack occurred Sunday evening to Monday morning and is attributed to the CODECO militia group.

According to the UN, the militia has massacred vulnerable displaced people at the Lala displacement site in Djugu territory.

Voters participating in the elections in Goma, an eastern city of the Democratic Republic of Congo nearly encircled by M23 rebels, are seeking leaders capable of ensuring security and stability for the country.

The residents of the conflict torn city voted as best as they could on Wednesday in a high-risk election in which the incumbent president, Félix Tshisekedi, is standing for re-election in the face of many socioeconomic challenges.

"After voting we are waiting for peace, for the war to end and for peace to return," says Claude Lola Henri, Congolese voter.

The elections are taking place in a country rich in natural resources, but where two-thirds of the population live below the poverty line, according to the World Bank. And many of the country's young people, 60% of whom are under 20, are unemployed.

"I'm afraid of the drawbacks, maybe (there could be) war because not everyone has voted, whereas if everyone has their choice, it should be fine," shared Pitié Mumbara, Congolese voter.

Casting his ballot, opponent Denis Mukwege is hopeful despite the situation.

"From these polls, the population expects change. We hope that change will come," said Dr. Denis Mukwege.

Suspicions of fraud led to incidents at several polling sites, with ransacking and violence against national electoral commission agents.

Opponents also denounced chaos and irregularities at the polling stations.

The umpteenth ceasefire has not been respected, the UN Security Council calls for negotiations which Kinshasa rejects and Angola announces the sending of soldiers as 25 years ago: despite intense activity diplomatically, the sky is not clearing up on the frontline of the M23 rebellion in eastern DRC.

Congolese government and diplomats say they still want to "give a chance" to the peace processes launched in Nairobi and Luanda, one of which aims to bring together around a table the many armed groups raging in the region, the other to silence the weapons of the M23 and to bring Rwanda closer to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Historically complicated, relations between the two neighbours have been execrable since the resurgence at the end of 2021 of the M23 (March 23 Movement), a majority Tutsi rebellion that Kinshasa claims to be supported by Kigali with the aim of monopolizing the wealth of eastern Congo.

Although Kigali still denies it, "it is no longer to be demonstrated that Rwanda supports the M23", declared Sunday in Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, Nicolas de Rivière, ambassador of France to the United Nations, following a visit to the DRC by a Security Council delegation.

The Congolese government is asking the international community to take sanctions against Rwanda for this "aggression". His interlocutors do not exclude it, but "the way out of the crisis can only be political, it can only be through negotiation", insisted Nicolas de Rivière and his Gabonese counterpart Michel-Xavier Obiang.

The Security Council "should rather go and tell the Rwandan government to withdraw its soldiers who kill the Congolese and bombard entire cities", reacted Monday in Goma Placide Nzilamba, actor of the civil society of North Kivu. "They don't bring us a solution", also believes Mamy Asumini Kayumba, a resident of Goma. "We have been living these atrocities for almost 30 years, it is time for it to end".

In one year, the conflict with the M23 caused the displacement of some 800,000 people, causing a major humanitarian crisis.

As things stand, "it is out of the question, I repeat, to negotiate with the M23", Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya declared at the end of February. "Let's be serious! The M23 is a terrorist movement," Foreign Minister Christophe Lutundula told the press on Monday evening.

Faced with a rebellion that is expanding its territory and has no strategic interest in ceasing fire, "the Congo is militarily in a difficult position", notes Reagan Miviri, a researcher at the Congolese institute Ebuteli. The UN delegates could only insist on the negotiations.

But negotiate on what? "It is very difficult to offer anything to the M23 in an election year," said the researcher. A presidential election, for which the outgoing head of state, Félix Tshisekedi, will be a candidate, is scheduled for December. Integrating M23 fighters into the army seems excluded and doing so in the administration "would be unpopular", continues Reagan Miviri.

Finally, surprise of the weekend, the Angolan government announced on Saturday that it would send a military unit to eastern DRC, after the failure of the ceasefire which should have come into force last Tuesday, to "secure the areas where members of the 23 are stationed".

This announcement brought back memories of the 1998-2002 war, which involved nine African countries and almost caused the country to implode.

A regional force, in which Kenyan and Burundian soldiers are already deployed, was created by the Community of East African States (ACS) and should precisely oversee the withdrawal of M23 fighters. The arrival of Angolans in the quagmire of the East, therefore, raises questions.

So far, the East African regional force has not forced the M23 to withdraw and finds itself criticized in the same way as the UN force present for 23 years in the country, where it has not reached to end the violence.

Angolan soldiers do not come "to attack, but to check how things are going", assured Monday evening the head of Congolese diplomacy. "There is no ambiguity, Angola is within its mandate", he insisted.

Rebels in eastern DRC were still holding strategic positions on Thursday, the day M23 militants were supposed to leave under a regional peace initiative.

The withdrawal of M23 rebels is now going to take place this Friday, according to the commander of the EAC force.

"From Friday, Ugandan soldiers from the East African regional force will enter Bunagana and deploy to Kiwanja and this is part of the schedule that has been decided..."We have agreed that their first mission is to ensure the security of our population. And we ask all humanitarian organisations to be able to deploy in all areas to help this population", said General Jeff Nyagah, EAC Regional Force Commander.

Since June last year that the town of Bunagana, a commercial crossroads on the Ugandan border, has been under rebel control.

"Customs are still closed and famine is getting much worse. Nothing works like it used to here. It's good that these Ugandan soldiers are coming in, but we would like the Congolese government and the M23 to hold talks so that a solution can be found", said Jean Muhire, a resident in Bunagana.

March 30th was supposed to mark the end of the withdrawal of "all armed groups", according to a timetable adopted in mid-February by the EAC.

The M23 has announced its withdrawal from certain localities, but these announcements have been described as a "diversion" by the Congolese army.

Fighting between the rebel M23 group and the army in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, continued on Monday, according to residents contacted by telephone by AFP from Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu.

According to the United Nations and the United States, the mostly ethnic M23 group is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which is mostly governed by ethnic Tutsis.

The clashes began on Sunday in two clusters of villages called Bishusha and Tongo.

"There was fighting between us and the M23 in Bishusha. Today, in Marangara, fighting continued between armed patriot groups and the M23, because our forces are not in Tongo," a Congolese army source told AFP, requesting anonymity. Marangara is a village in the Tongo cluster.

A security source confirmed the clashes and added that "the army is still occupying its positions.”

Meanwhile, in Tongo and the surrounding area, about 50 people accused of collaborating with the Nyatura, which is a mostly ethnic Hutu Congolese militia, and the FDLR, which is a militia founded by mostly ethnic Rwandan Hutus, were kidnapped by the M23, Cyprien Ngoragore, a local leader, told AFP.

About 15, including women, have so far been released, he said but at least "18 civilians accused of colluding" with the two armed groups were still in the hands of the M23 rebels, he added.

Two relatives of some of those kidnapped told AFP that the hostages were taken to the town of Rutshuru, currently considered one of the M23's bases.

"We tried to contact the M23, they told us that our brothers are alive," the nephew of one hostage said.

They were "displaced people coming back to get food, they are accused of working with the FDLR and Nyatura. We ask that our brothers be released. Let the government get involved," the man implored, speaking on condition of anonymity.

"My father is 76 years old," another man said, adding that he was kidnapped with the others last Monday. "They spent three days in a cell, they were tied up before being transferred to Rutshuru. They are accused of working with the Nyatura and FDLR," he said.

The M23, is a mostly Congolese ethnic Tutsi armed group which was defeated in 2013 but took up arms again late last year. In recent months it has conquered large swathes of territory in North Kivu, a Congolese province bordering Rwanda.

Congolese ethnic Tutsi and Hutu groups have long been caught up in the violence in the east, with some joining an array of militia groups.

Much of the violence has its roots in the Rwandan genocide of 1994. It was perpetrated by Rwanda’s majority ethnic Hutu group, which wanted to wipe out the minority Tutsis and those who supported them.

Today Rwanda’s government remains dominated by ethnic Tutsis and they remain the minority group.

Why DR Congo wants East African troops to leave

27 October 2023 Share Save Ian Wafula & Kenneth Mungai BBC News, Nairobi Share Save

AFP The group is made up of soldiers from Kenya, Burundi, South Sudan and Uganda

After just 11 months in action, the East African force set up to to curb militia violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been ordered to leave the country. The Congolese government said it would not extend the East Africa Community (EAC) Regional Force's mandate after months of Kinshasa complaining about the group's ineffectiveness. The decision not to extend the troops' stay comes as violence between the M23 rebel group and pro-government militias erupts in DR Congo's troubled eastern region once more.

What was the regional troop's mandate?

The East African Community (EAC) - a union of seven countries - sent its troops to DR Congo last year after a resurgence in fighting by the M23. The force was agreed shortly after DR Congo had joined the regional club. Formed more than 10 years ago, the M23 has taken over large swathes of territory in the east, arguing that it does so to defend the interest of ethnic Tutsis against Hutu militias it says are backed by the government. Burundi was the first of four countries to send its troops to DR Congo in August last year, followed by Kenya, South Sudan and Uganda, with Kenya in overall command. The EAC's Regional Force insists its mandate is to oversee the withdrawal of armed groups from captured areas. However, the Congolese government and local communities want the force to engage in direct combat with groups like the M23. The force was established to work alongside United Nations troops who were already in the country. The UN peacekeeping force, known as Monusco, has become increasingly unpopular for its failure to end the conflict during its 25-year deployment. President Félix Tshisekedi said he wanted Monusco to withdraw from the country in December. In a recent statement, the EAC said its forces were dedicated to working closely with the government to enable the safe return of internally displaced people to their homes and enhance the overall protection of civilians. Its mandate has been extended twice since the mission began.

Why does DR Congo want East African troops to leave?

The EAC's soldiers have received repeated criticism from the Congolese government and civil society groups throughout their deployment. President Tshisekedi has become one of the force's main detractors. He has complained about the mission's "lack of effectiveness", issuing ultimatums for them to act more aggressively against the M23 or leave the country. The failure to end the conflict has led to demonstrations against both the EAC force and Monusco. One such protest in September turned deadly, with more than 40 people losing their lives. According to local media, Communications Minister Patrick Muyaya said: "The message is clear: the EAC regional force must leave the Democratic Republic of Congo by 8 December, as agreed, because it has not been able to resolve the problem, particularly that of the M23."

What has the EAC force achieved?

Since entering DR Congo last year, the EAC force said it had overseen the withdrawal of armed forces from several areas like Karuba, Mushaki, Kiloriwe and Kitchange. However, achieving complete stability has proven to be challenging. The force has faced logistical and operational difficulties. On Tuesday, a mortar attack launched by rebels killed a Kenyan soldier attached to the force. He was the first Kenyan member of the force to be killed. Earlier this month the EAC said its forces had faced hostilities because of propaganda perpetuated by armed groups.

Why has fighting resumed?

M23 rebels on Friday handed over the Rumangabo army base to east African regional forces, after nearly two months in charge.

At a brief ceremony held at the facility, a rebel representative said the gesture symbolizes the group's commitment to peace.

A summit held in the Angolan capital last November ordered the rebels to vacate all Congolese territory under their occupation.

The Rumangabo base located in the Rutshuru territory fell to the rebels in November.

In December, the rebels withdrew from another strategic town of Kibumba but have since gone on to capture more territory.

The Congolese military has called the withdrawals a sham.

The M23's resurgence has cratered relations between the DRC and its smaller central African neighbour Rwanda, which Kinshasa accuses of backing the rebels.

The United States, several European countries as well as United Nations experts agree that Rwanda is assisting the M23.

Kigali denies the charge, and accuses the Congolese government of colluding with the FDLR - a descendant of Rwandan Hutu extremist groups that carried out the 1994 Tutsi genocide in Rwanda.

A senior United States diplomat said Washington had offered to extend an important railway infrastructure project into the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

The US has been supporting the Lobito Corridor that links the resource-rich but landlocked DRC and Zambia to a port on Angola’s Atlantic coast.

Outgoing assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Molly Phee, said the proposal was seen as an incentive for a peace deal between the DRC and Rwanda, but that Kigali seemed to have walked away from it.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame did not attend a summit in Luanda in December during President Joe Biden’s visit to Angola.

The eastern part of the DRC has struggled for decades with armed violence as more than 120 groups fight for power, land, and valuable mineral resources.

This includes the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels who have seized large swathes of the region.

Kagame has never admitted his country is directly involved in the fighting, which the United Nations has displaced close to two million people in the province.

A rebel group in Congo generates around $300,000 a month in revenue through its control of a mining area in the east of the country, a U.N. official said.

In April, the M23 — a rebel group with alleged links to Rwanda — seized the Rubaya mining area in eastern Congo, which holds deposits of a key mineral used in the production of smartphones and computers. Over 15% of the world's supply of tantalum, a rare metal extracted from coltan, comes from Rubaya, Bintou Keita, head of the U.N. mission in Congo, told the Security Council on Monday.

“Unless international sanctions are imposed on those benefiting from this criminal trade, peace will remain elusive and civilians will continue to suffer,” Keita said.

Tantalum is among the minerals that were identified earlier this year in a letter from Congo’s government questioning Apple about the tech company’s knowledge of “blood minerals” being smuggled in its supply chain.

The decadeslong conflict in eastern Congo has produced one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with more than 120 armed groups fighting for power, land and valuable mineral resources while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings, rapes and other human rights violations. The violence has displaced some 6 million people in the country's east.

M23, or the March 23 Movement, is a rebel military group mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis that broke away from the Congolese army just over a decade ago. They staged a large offensive in 2012 and took over the provincial capital of Goma near the border with Rwanda, the same city they are threatening again.

Congo alleges that Rwanda has been involved in war crimes in the east and U.S. and U.N. experts accuse it of giving military backing to M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border.

In July, U.N. experts estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan government forces are deployed in eastern Congo alongside M23, which has been making major advances.

Last week, a regional court in East Africa opened proceedings in a case filed by Congo against Rwanda, accusing it of violating Congo’s sovereignty and territorial integrity by sending troops to help rebels in the country’s east.

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — Aid organizations fear a new humanitarian crisis in the restive eastern Congo region, where the renowned armed rebel group M23 is in the midst of a new advance that threatens to cut off a major city and leave millions of people struggling for food and medical help.

Eastern Congo has been beset by conflict for years, with M23 among more than 100 armed groups vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich area near the border with Rwanda. Some have been accused of carrying out mass killings.

There’s been an upsurge in fighting in recent weeks between M23 rebels and Congo army forces, and it comes as the United Nations plans to withdraw peacekeepers from the region by the end of the year.

Tensions are also rising between Congo and Rwanda, with them blaming each other for supporting various armed groups. Congo accuses Rwanda of backing M23.

This weekend, the U.S. State Department condemned what it called the “worsening violence.” A group of aid agencies has estimated that 1 million people have already been displaced by fighting in the last three months.

WHO ARE M23?

The March 23 Movement, or M23, is a rebel military group mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis that broke away from the Congolese army just over a decade ago. They staged a large offensive in 2012 and took over the provincial capital of Goma near the border with Rwanda, the same city they are threatening again.

The conflict has regional complications, with neighboring Rwanda also accused by the U.S. and U.N. experts of giving military aid to M23. Rwanda denies that but effectively admitted on Monday that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo. Rwanda said that is to safeguard its own security because of what it claims is a buildup of Congo army forces near the border. Rwanda has rejected calls from the U.S. to withdraw.

There are also ties to the Rwandan genocide of 30 years ago, with M23 and Rwanda saying separately that they are fighting a threat from a Congolese rebel group that is connected to the Congo army and partly made up of ethnic Hutus who were perpetrators of the 1994 genocide.

CONGO-RWANDA TENSIONS

Relations between Congo and its eastern neighbor have been fraught for decades. Hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees had fled to Congo, then Zaire, in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Among them were soldiers and militiamen responsible for the slaughter of 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

Two years after the genocide, Rwanda and Uganda invaded eastern Congo to try and root out what remained of those genocide perpetrators, which led to the toppling of then Congo President Mobutu Sese Seko.

Tensions between Congo and Rwanda escalated in 2021 with the resurgence of M23 attacks on Congolese soldiers after nearly a decade of relative inactivity due to a 2013 peace deal. The presence of so many armed groups is believed to be connected to illegal mining, with eastern Congo rich in gold and other minerals.

WHAT’S HAPPENED IN RECENT WEEKS?

M23 launched new attacks late last year and has ramped them up in recent weeks. The group is now threatening to take the key town of Sake, about 27 kilometers (16 miles) west of Goma. That could cause food and aid supplies to be cut off from Goma, which had a population of around 600,000 a few years ago, but now holds more than 2 million people, according to aid agencies, as people flee violence in surrounding towns and villages.

The advance of rebels on Sake “poses an imminent threat to the entire aid system” in eastern Congo, the Norwegian Refugee Council said. It said 135,000 people were displaced in just five days in early February.

The violence has also sparked protests from the capital, Kinshasa, to Goma, with angry demonstrators saying the international community is not doing enough to push back against M23 and not taking a hard enough stance against Rwanda.

WHAT’S AT STAKE?

The new fighting could lead to an escalation of regional tensions and involve more countries. As the U.N. winds down its 25-year peacekeeping mission in eastern Congo, a multi-national force under the southern African regional bloc is set to step in. That force will include soldiers from regional power South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania. They will help the Congo army forces, but it might put them in direct conflict with Rwanda.

There’s also the humanitarian cost. The International NGO Forum in Congo, a group of non-governmental organizations working in the region, said the escalation in fighting has involved artillery attacks on civilian settlements, causing a heavy toll and forcing many health and aid workers to withdraw.

Eastern Congo already had one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, with nearly 6 million people previously displaced because of conflict, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency.

There are concerns a new disaster could largely go unnoticed because of the attention on the war in Gaza and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — Between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwanda government forces are deployed in neighboring eastern Congo, operating alongside the M23 rebel group which has been making major advances, U.N. experts said in a report circulated Wednesday.

The experts called the estimate of Rwandan troops “conservative” and said their “systematic support and presence” supporting M23 in its territorial conquest is a sanctionable act, and their deployment is a violation of Congo’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The Rwandan forces’ “de facto control and direction over M23 operations also renders Rwanda liable for the actions of M23,” the panel of experts said in the The 293-page report to the U.N. Security Council.

Eastern Congo has struggled with armed violence as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources, while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings.

Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi, along with U.S. and U.N. experts, have accused Rwanda of giving military backing to M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February it effectively admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border.

At the root of the current crisis is the 1994 Rwanda genocide. The carnage began when a plane carrying Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was shot down, killing the leader, who like most Rwandans was an ethnic Hutu. The country’s minority Tutsis were blamed, and bands of Hutu extremists began killing them with support from Rwanda’s army, police and militias.

Rwanda’s current president, Paul Kagame, a Tutsi and former opposition military commander, is widely credited with stopping the genocide which killed more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus who tried to protect them. Thousands of Hutus fled Rwanda to neighboring eastern Congo.

The M23 rebels are largely Congolese ethnic Tutsis, who became prominent when their fighters seized Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city on the border with Rwanda, in November 2012.

Rwandan Ambassador Ernest Rwamucyo told the Security Council Monday that Congo and the international community have failed to ensure the protection of Congolese citizens, especially Congolese Tutsis, who he claimed “are being ethnically cleansed by armed groups.”

He reiterated that the FDLR rebel group — which he said is supported by Congo’s highest authorities and has vowed to cause regime change in Rwanda — remains “a threat to Rwanda and the Great Lakes region.” The FDLR is comprised mainly of Hutus opposed to Tutsi influence, and reportedly includes some Hutus that participated in the Rwanda genocide.

The panel of experts said the estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan troops in Congo were deployed in three regions of eastern North Kivu – Nyiragongo, Rutshuru and Masisi – when their report was being drafted in April. It said the troops were from the military’s 2nd and 3rd divisions, citing intelligence and security sources close to M23 and the Rwandan military and confidential documents.

The experts said Rwandan military interventions and operations in the three territories “were critical to the impressive territorial expansion achieved between January and March 2024.”

The top U.N. official in Congo, special envoy Bintou Keita, told the council Monday that she was extremely concerned at the continuing rapid expansion of attacks by the M23 rebel group and its capture of several strategic locations in eastern North Kivu in the last two weeks, and the spillover into neighboring South Kivu.

She said violence has reached “alarming levels” and risks provoking a wider regional conflict.

The panel of experts also said “The rapidly escalating M23 crisis carried the risk of triggering a wider regional conflict.”

A two-week humanitarian truce began last Friday in eastern Congo, but there has been no indication the violence has stopped.

The experts said they documented the proliferation and use of advanced military technology and equipment, mainly from Rwanda, by M23 and Rwandan forces in violation of a U.N. arms embargo. It cited short-range air defense systems, mortar shells carried by drones, and 120mm guided mortar shells which have “precision strike capability and high lethality.”

The experts said these advances altered the “conflict dynamics” including by grounding all Congolese military air assets.

In December, a new political-military movement called the Alliance Fleuve Congo, or AFC, was launched with the aim of uniting armed groups, political parties and civil society against Congo’s government. But the experts said the AFC “failed to coalesce the majority of political and armed actors against the government.”

The panel said Congolese government forces continue to use the Wazelendo group of irregular fighters in North Kivu and the FDLR “as proxies” in the fight against the M23 and Rwandan forces as well as Burundi government forces, which has exacerbated tensions between Rwanda and Burundi.

Congo has said it will not require the withdrawal of UN peacekeepers from its North Kivu province due to the presence of Rwandan forces and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels.

Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner said that the situation in the east of the country was not conducive for a troop pullout.

A U.N. report said this week 3,000-4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting the Congolese army and overseeing rebel operations.

On Friday, the Congolese army accused the rebels of violating a humanitarian ceasefire announced by the US.

President Felix Tshisekedi last September demanded the withdrawal of peacekeepers, accusing them of refusing to confront the rebels. Dozens of people were killed in demonstrations targeting MONUSCO bases in eastern Congo.

A first phase saw peacekeepers complete their departure from South Kivu province in June.

The M23 rebels rekindled their insurgency in 2022, taking vast areas of North Kivu from government hands and displacing close to a million people.

The rebels say they are protecting ethnic Tutsi communities from genocide.

Some fifteen embassies in Kinshasa on Saturday called for "restraint" after the elections in the DRC, described as a "sham" by the opposition, which is already planning a demonstration, as the first results are just starting to come in.

"In a joint statement, the embassies of 12 European countries and Canada called on all parties (...) to continue to show restraint as the vote count continues.

On Friday evening, on X (formerly Twitter), the US embassy had also "urged all political leaders to continue to exercise restraint and resolve differences peacefully".

On Wednesday, some 44 million of the approximately 100 million inhabitants of this vast Central African country were called upon to elect their president, national and provincial deputies and communal councillors.

The incumbent president, Félix Tshisekedi, is seeking a second term against 18 other candidates, including several opposition heavyweights who had already denounced the "chaos" surrounding the vote on Wednesday.

Faced with the many logistical problems that prevented many polling stations from opening as scheduled, the electoral commission (Céni) extended the poll.

Officially, voting ended on Thursday evening, but according to local sources, voting continued in remote areas of several provinces.

For example, in the Lubero territory of North Kivu province (east), electoral material arrived by helicopter in the village of Mabuo on Saturday, before being transported on foot to four other localities (Engobo, Lenda, Bududia, Isange), Macaire Kambau Sivikunula, head of the Bapere sector, which includes these localities, told AFP.

Due to a "special dispensation" from the Céni, "voting will take place tomorrow (Sunday) at these five sites", he added.

''Great tension"

The failure to hold the vote on December 20, "interpreted as a plot", had "caused great tension" among the population, who "threatened to kill me, my family and the Céni agents who are staying with me", explained Mr. Kambau.

Félix Tshisekedi's opponents include Moïse Katumbi, former governor of the southeastern mining region of Katanga, Martin Fayulu, who claims he was robbed of victory in the 2018 election, and Denis Mukwege, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for his work with women victims of wartime rape.

In a letter made public on Saturday, five opposition candidates, including Mr. Fayulu and Mr. Mukwege, informed the governor of Kinshasa of their intention to organize a march next Wednesday. "We will protest against the irregularities observed during the voting operations", they wrote, describing the ballot as a "sham election".

Among the observer missions, that of the African Union considered that the elections had "taken place in a relatively calm atmosphere with major logistical challenges". The American NGO Carter Center pointed to "serious irregularities" in some polling stations.

On Saturday, the "Regard citoyen" mission reported that in 21% of the polling stations observed by its teams, "some voters were refused entry without any legal basis". Conversely, in 13% of polling stations observed, people without cards and not registered on the list "were allowed to vote".

For their part, the authorities and the Céni affirm that voting was not "chaotic".

"The challenge of holding the elections on December 20 has been met, despite the difficulties inherent in a complex process involving millions of voters and over 100,000 candidates," said government spokesman Patrick Muyaya. "We are now calmly awaiting the results," he added on X.

"If some people see a glass half empty, we see a glass three quarters full", declared Denis Kadima, Chairman of the Céni, on Friday evening, just before the announcement of the very first results.

The Céni began with the Congolese diaspora, who were able to vote for the first time in five test countries. In view of the number of registered voters, who represent 0.03% of the total, these results are not significant. But Félix Tshisekedi's score of some 80% of the vote was nonetheless celebrated in certain regions where he has a strong following.

The dissemination of results is due to continue on Saturday.

Protesters in Goma took to the streets on Sunday, responding to the opposition's call for mobilization against the results of the Democratic Republic of Congo's presidential election, which saw President Felix Tshisekedi re-elected with over 70% of the vote, according to the country's election commission.

The preliminary results, announced in Kinshasa, faced opposition demands and civil society calls for a rerun due to significant logistical issues casting doubt on the validity of the outcome.

Tshisekedi's victory was followed by businessman Moise Katumbi with 18% and Martin Fayulu with 5%. Nobel Peace Prize winner Denis Mukwege, known for treating victims of sexual violence, received less than 1%.

With a turnout of more than 40%, the election saw 18 million people casting their votes. The results are now slated for confirmation by the constitutional court, as stated by election chief Denis Kadima.

The Congolese army on Thursday accused the M23 rebels and Rwanda of violating a humanitarian ceasefire announced by the United States last week.

The two-week ceasefire, in force since July 5, aimed to allow humanitarian workers to access conflict zones in the North Kivu province where millions of people are experiencing one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

Only a week in, there have been reports of continued violence in Masisi territory near Goma, the capital of North Kivu, according to the United Nations.

The conflict in the region has intensified this year, displacing hundreds of thousands in an attempt to flee rebels.

Kinshasa has accused Rwanda of backing the M23 rebel group and on Thursday denounced what it called "the Kigali regime's failure to respect the truce [...] thus denying them access to humanitarian aid."

The years-long conflict is highly complex, and while M23 is the most active, there are over 120 armed groups fighting over the region's minerals.

More than 7 million people are now displaced across the east of the DRC. This year alone, at least 416 violent attacks have left 1,467 civilians dead, half of whom were in North Kivu, according to non-profit ACLED.

The European Union announced on Wednesday that it was cancelling its election observation mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, citing "technical" reasons.

On Tuesday evening, the EU had stated that its election observers who had arrived in the DRC had been unable to "deploy across the country for security reasons", making their mission "impossible".

"Due to technical constraints beyond the EU's control, we are forced to cancel the election observation mission," said European Union diplomatic service spokeswoman Nabila Massrali in a statement released on Wednesday.

She added that essential telecommunications equipment had not been made available to the observers deployed in the country ahead of the December 20 polls.

"The EU encourages the DRC authorities and all stakeholders to continue their efforts to ensure that the Congolese people can fully exercise their legitimate political and civil rights in the forthcoming elections," added the spokeswoman, quoted in the statement.

She added that "the EU is examining other options with the Congolese authorities, including the possibility of maintaining a mission of electoral experts to observe the electoral process from the capital".

The Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast Central African country with a population of almost 100 million, is due to hold legislative and presidential elections on December 20th, in which incumbent President Félix Tshisekedi, 60, is seeking a second term.

Mr. Tshisekedi came to power in the last elections in 2018. At the time, many observers, including representatives of the Catholic Church in the DRC, felt that the elections were marred by irregularities.

This European electoral observation mission, the first in the DRC for over 10 years, was announced in early November by the EU's head of diplomacy, Josep Borrell. "The coming months will be decisive for the consolidation of democracy in the DRC and for bilateral cooperation between the DRC and the EU", he said.

For almost 30 years, the DRC has been shaken by violence from armed groups in the east of the country, where peacekeeping troops from the UN and the Community of East African States (EAC) are deployed.

The violence is currently peaking with the return of a former rebel movement, the M23 ("March 23 Movement"), supported by neighboring Rwanda, according to numerous sources.

President Tshisekedi's government has decided not to renew beyond December 8 the mandate of the EAC force deployed to combat the M23.

Meanwhile, the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC (Monusco), present in the country since 1999, declared last week that it had signed a plan with the government to withdraw its 14,000 peacekeepers deployed in the country.

Escalating violence in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has led to the displacement of at least 250,000 people over the past month, a senior United Nations official said on Wednesday, describing the situation as a humanitarian crisis.

Far from the country's capital, Kinshasa, eastern Congo has long been overrun by more than 120 armed groups seeking a share of the region's gold and other resources while carrying out massacres. The result is one of the world's largest humanitarian crises, with an estimated 7 million people displaced, many of whom are beyond the reach of aid.

"It's really heartbreaking (and) what I saw is really a horrible situation," Ramesh Rajasingham, director of coordination at the United Nations humanitarian office, told the Associated Press. Mr. Rajasingham travelled to the city of Goma, where many people took refuge. “Such several people displaced in such a short time is unprecedented,” he said.

Amid intensifying fighting with security forces, the M23 rebel group – the most dominant in the region and believed to have links to neighbouring Rwanda – continued to attack villages, forcing many to flee to Goma, the region's largest city, whose estimated population of 2 million is already overwhelmed by inadequate resources.

Although M23 has said it targets security forces and not civilians, it has besieged several communities, with about half of North Kivu province under its control, according to Richard Moncrieff, Crisis' Great Lakes region director. Group, leaving many people trapped and beyond the reach of humanitarian aid.

“We fled insecurity, but here too, we live in constant fear,” said Chance Wabiwa, 20, in Goma where she took refuge. “Finding a peaceful place has become a utopia for us. Perhaps we will never have this chance again,” said Chance Wabiwa.

Re-elected for a second five-year term in December, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi accused neighbouring Rwanda of providing military support to the rebels. Rwanda denies the accusations, but UN experts have said there is substantial evidence of the presence of its forces in Congo.

Regional and UN peacekeeping forces have been asked to leave Congo after the government accused them of failing to resolve the conflict.

Mr Rajasingham said humanitarian agencies were doing their best to reach people affected by the conflict, but he warned that "a huge influx of people poses challenges that are beyond what we can do at the moment".

“We must find a solution to the suffering, the displacement, the loss of livelihoods, the loss of education,” he said.

The Democratic Republic of Congo's conflict-driven hunger crisis is worsening as violence in the eastern province’s surges, forcing families to flee once again.

More and more people are arriving at overcrowded camps where there is a lack of food, sanitation and shelter.

Just since February, 230,000 people have been displaced to Goma by the M23 conflict bringing the total estimated displaced population to almost a million people around the city - almost double what it was four months ago.

Eastern Congo has been riddled by conflict for decades, linked to more than 120 armed groups fighting for land and power and in some cases, protecting their communities.

The government said the violence in the east has plagued the country with recurrent conflict and resulted in a surge of attacks that have spread terror among the communities.

In recent years, the M23 rebel group — the most dominant in the region with alleged links to neighboring Rwanda — has continued to attack villages, forcing many to flee to Goma, the region’s largest city.

M23 has laid siege to several communities with about half of North Kivu province under its control.

The violence in the province has worsened in recent weeks as security forces battle the rebels.

Residents have said the group’s fighters mostly launch attacks with bombs out of hills overlooking remote towns.

Families face extreme shortages as they have inadequate shelter, and limited access to water, food and protection from abuse.

In DRC, WFP’s emergency response in the east said it has tripled its beneficiary reach, from an average of 400,000 people in May 2023 to an average of 1.3 million people today.

Nearly one million people have been displaced due to conflict since the start of the year, leading to food shortages and increased commodity prices in Goma's markets.

Around a quarter of DRC’s population – 23.4 million people – are facing crisis levels of hunger or worse.

Many live in poor and cramped conditions with little or no access to food, health services, and education.

At the heart of a deepening hunger crisis lies a troubling situation for women and girls, particularly those living in IDP camps, where they face a constant threat from sexual violence.

Funding shortages mean WFP is forced to choose who gets food and who goes without, it said, especially in the east where humanitarian needs and conflict are surging.

WFP needs US$ 548.5 million to keep comprehensive operations in the DRC, it said.

On Tuesday, France called for an end to Rwanda's "ongoing military support" for the M23 rebels in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and condemned the atrocities perpetrated by the many groups terrorizing the region.

"France is concerned by reports confirming the continued presence of the M23 in territories in the east of the DRC, Rwanda's ongoing military support for this armed group and the presence of Rwandan soldiers on Congolese territory. This support, which we condemn, must cease", according to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

A mainly Tutsi rebellion, the M23, accused by the UN of numerous crimes in the east of the DRC, took up arms again at the end of 2021 after ten years of dormancy and has seized vast swathes of territory in the Congolese province of North Kivu, bordering Rwanda and Uganda.

"The commitments made by the various regional players must now be put into practice in order to speed up the withdrawal of the M23 from the occupied territories, to confine this group and to encourage all armed groups to commit to the national demobilization and disarmament process", continues the Quai d'Orsay, which raises the possibility of "sanctions against those who obstruct peace".

During his trip to the DRC in March, French President Emmanuel Macron issued a warning to Kigali, without however clearly condemning Rwanda.

In its statement, the Quai d'Orsay also condemned "the many abuses committed by the armed groups cited in the latest report by the UN group of experts". In addition to the M23, other groups such as the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), the Mai Mai and the Forces Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda (FDLR) are terrorizing the region.

These violations "cannot go unpunished", emphasizes the Quai d'Orsay, calling for an end to "the support given by the Congolese armed forces to certain armed groups such as the FDLR".

In a report published on Monday, UN experts sounded the alarm over the "galloping violence" and "growing humanitarian needs" in the east of the DRC. They also established that the ADF rebels were receiving financial support from the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The president of the Democratic Republic of Congo delivered Tuesday (Nov. 14) a state of the nation address.

During over 2 hours Felix Tshisekedi spoke before the members of the Parliament's two chambers meeting in congress in Kinshasa.

Tshisekedi who has spent nearly 5 years in office, addressed the resurgence of the M23 rebel group.

"Against the backdrop of the barbaric aggression on our country perpetrated by Rwanda and its M23 terrorist supporters in the last two years, I salute your commitment," he told the assembly.

In response to the ongoing fighting, several foreign forces are deployed in the DRC's east.

The president who seeks re-election revie wed his government's military alliances.

"As part of its peace-building efforts, the government is offering its cooperation to certain international forces present on our territory as part of our international commitments. In the case of some of these forces, the mechanisms for their withdrawal are being discussed. This is the case for MONUSCO and the regional force of the East Africa Community."

The war and insecurity in the DRC's east means swathes of territory are not under the control of the state. That could disenfranchise millions of voters. Still, Tshisekedi backed the decision to maintain the vote.

" I cannot conclude my remarks about you without specifically mentioning the determination you have shown to support me in my solemn commitment to consolidate our young and fragile democracy by organising electoral polls in strict compliance with constitutional deadlines."

The Constitutional Court is due to unveil on November 18 the final list of candidates allowed to contest in the December 20 presidential election.

The UDPS party leader also announced targeted interventions on commodity prices and monetary policies to stabilize the Congolese Franc as Congolese grapple with high inflation and a cost-of-living crisis.

if the campaign for next month's election has not started Tshisekedi's closing remark sounded like it: "We have the choice to go back to square one or to consolidate what has been delivered [...]"

The Congolese army spokesman, General Sylvain Ekenge, affirms that movements of the Rwandan army and the M23 rebellion are underway in the province of North Kivu with a view, according to him, "to attack the city of Goma".

Asked by AFP on Tuesday, an M23 spokesperson did not immediately react to the general's statements released on Monday evening.

Located in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Goma is wedged between the Rwandan border to the east, Lake Kivu to the south, the Masisi mountains to the west, and, to the north, the territory of Rutshuru, partly controlled by the M23 and where an East African Community (EAC) military force was recently deployed.

The population of Goma is estimated at more than one million inhabitants, to which have been added in recent months a million people who have fled the advance of the M23 rebels, supported by units of the Rwandan army, according to experts from the UN. A ceasefire has been observed in the area since mid-March.

Last Thursday, during the Council of Ministers, the new Minister of Defense and ex-warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba declared that the Rwandan army and the M23 were strengthening their positions "in anticipation of a general offensive" with the objective " the occupation" of Goma.

The army spokesman specifies that recruits have just "completed their training in Rwanda and at Tchanzu (hill near the Rwandan border)" and are deployed at the exit of Goma, in Kibumba and Rugari, areas supposed to be "under control of EAC force".

The main sticking point between the DRC and its neighbors is the mandate of this force, which the Congolese authorities accuse of complacency towards the rebellion.

In early May, at a summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi condemned the "observed cohabitation" between EAC troops and "M23 terrorists".

Following the announcement of possible troop dispatch by SADC countries, President Tshisekedi said the East African force could be asked to leave the country at the end of June - just three months after its full deployment - because "the mission assigned to this force is not fulfilled."

According to diplomatic sources in Kinshasa and within the EAC, a meeting of East African heads of state is to be held in Kenya around June 3.

In addition, in recent days, attack drones operated by Agemira, a private military company headed by two Frenchmen, have been observed in the skies of Kinshasa. According to military sources, they are to be deployed soon in the East to reinforce the system against the M23.

East African regional forces have announced that are now in control of Bunagana, a strategic town in eastern DRC previously held by M23 rebels for more than nine months.

The spokesman for the Ugandan contingent of the regional force, Captain Kato Ahmad Hassan, confirmed that the M23 rebels had been cooperative during the transition process.

The rebels' departure from Bunagana has been a key demand during several rounds of mediation efforts on the crisis in eastern Congo, where more than 120 armed groups have been fighting for land, power and resources and some to protect their communities.

Ugandan troops, which are part of the East African Community Regional Force in eastern Congo, will now try to bring about M23's sequenced withdrawal from other areas under rebel control including Kiwanja and Mabenga.

The M23 rebel group has captured Kitshanga, a stratregic town in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo from government troops, in its latest seizure of territory in North Kivu province.

Hundreds of civilians have fled their homes.

The rebels took the town on Thursday evening, after capturing several villages on the road that links it to the provincial capital Goma.

Kitshanga sits on the last open route between North Kivu's main economic hubs of Goma and Butembo. The others were cut off due to the fighting.

"We tactically withdrew outside the city, in order to attract these genocidaires in depth and to avoid the worst for our populations of Kitshanga", lieutenant-colonel Guillaume Ndjike, spokesman of the military governor of North Kivu told AFP. "We are doing everything we can to dislodge this enemy," he added.

"We are with rebels here in the city," said a Kitshanga resident interviewed from Goma. "The M23 controls all of Kitshanga and this morning the rebels are advancing towards Mweso."

Kinshasa for months has accused neighbouring Rwanda of supporting the M23 group — whose origins lie in the region's ethnic fighting — and powerful voices in the West have openly agreed. Rwanda denies backing the group, which is one of the dozens operating in the mineral-rich east.

At a Nov. 23 summit in Angola, which included Congo’s president and Rwanda’s foreign minister, regional leaders called for a cease-fire in eastern Congo to be followed by a withdrawal of rebels from major towns under M23 control.

The group said it would leave some of the occupied territories before Jan. 15, but some areas remain under its control and it's seeking to capture others from government forces. M23 has been accused by the United Nations and rights groups of atrocities against civilians.

Many of Kitshanga's inhabitants fled Thursday's violence.

“We have just been through the war in Kitshanga, we saw M23 killing people, we were afraid, that’s why we fled so we wouldn’t die too,” said Angelique Mukeshimana. The mother of four went to a makeshift displacement site on the outskirts of Goma, some 150 kilometres away, leaving all her belongings behind.

The fighting comes days before Pope Francis is due in Congo's capital Kinshasa for a three-day visit. The trip was originally supposed to include a stop in the east, however, the Vatican scrapped that amid the rising violence.

M23′s political spokesman, Lawrence Kanyuka, in a statement on Thursday accused government troops of attacking civilians in Kitchanga and elsewhere, and said the rebel group was “obliged to intervene and stop another genocide.”

A spokesperson for a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo said more than 500 civilians have taken refuge in and around the U.N. peacekeeping base in Kitchanga, where they've been given tents, food, water and first aid.

“The M23 must cease all hostilities and withdraw from the occupied areas," Ndeye Khady Lo said.

Analysts say the rebel group's drive to expand has devastating consequences for civilians.

“If reports that the group has taken control of Kitshanga ... are true, this is yet another indication of the group’s ongoing territorial ambitions and apparent unwillingness to withdraw,” said Daniel Levine-Spound, a researcher at the Center for Civilians in Conflict.

“The group’s continued westward expansion also raises meaningful fears that M23 could seek to fully encircle Goma. Sustained international pressure, including on M23’s backers, will be critical in halting the group’s advance,” he said.

Largely comprised of Congolese ethnic Tutsis, M23 rose to prominence 10 years ago when it seized Goma on the border with Rwanda. It's part of a long line of rebel groups linked with Rwanda since the 1990s when the country sought out ethnic Hutu militias, who had fled to Congo after killing Rwandan Tutsis during the genocide.

The United Nations has said it is ready to take action on the issue of violence against women and girls in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). But the reopening of the roads lasted less than 24 hours, the provincial capital of North Kivu said on Thursday.

"The movement of goods and merchandise is now authorised" on a series of roads controlled by the M23, Lieutenant-Colonel Guillaume Ndjike, spokesman for the provincial governor, announced in a statement on Wednesday evening. Shortly after this announcement, a first convoy returned to Goma without major incident.

The measure has been "suspended until further notice", the governorate said in a new statement late on Thursday, claiming that the rebels had just "killed a driver" and "looted all the goods".

Since late October 2022, the M23 has seized large swathes of North Kivu, cutting off traffic on the province's main roads.

"I have just arrived (in Goma) after enormous suffering. We stayed there for two months, sleeping under the vehicles," Zawadi Kavira, a passenger stranded in Mweso, on the other side of the front lines, about 100km north of Goma, told AFP on Thursday.

Like her, dozens of transporters and passengers coming from the north found themselves blocked by the clashes. "When we arrived in Mweso, we were blocked because of the fighting in Kitshanga," said one driver.

This town of about 60,000 inhabitants came under rebel control on 26 January. Since then, the M23 has been advancing and continuing to tighten its grip on Goma, a city of more than a million inhabitants, wedged between the Rwandan border to the east, Lake Kivu to the south and the rebels to the north and west.

On 28 February, a group of deputies from North Kivu and the provincial representative of the Fédération des entreprises du congo (FEC), in two separate letters, asked the governor and the president of the Republic to reopen the roads in order to "allow the evacuation of foodstuffs to the town of Goma", the FEC said.

The governor had responded positively to their request "in the interest of the population, which is suffering from the effects of the war", before reversing his decision the following day.

The M23 (for "Movement of 23 March") is a rebellion with a Tutsi majority that remained dormant for nearly ten years and reappeared at the end of 2021. Kinshasa accuses Rwanda of supporting it, which has been corroborated by UN experts.

Fighting reportedly flared on Monday (Feb. 19) between the DR Congo's army and M23 rebels.

Speaking on condition of anonymity, a security source said clashes began on 5:am in the Kitshanga area, northwest of the main eastern city of Goma.

The fighting come as regional leaders called once again on Friday for a ceasefire and for all armed groups to withdraw from occupied territory by March 30.

It is believed that over 120 armed groups and self-defense militias fight in eastern DRC.

The M23 group whose name stands for the March 23 Movement, re-emerged from dormancy in November 2021, accusing the DRC of ignoring a promise to integrate its fighters into the army.

Winning a string of victories over state forces the rebels now near the provincial capital Goma.

The Democratic Republic of Congo accuses its neighbour Rwanda of backing the rebels, a charge supported by a group of UN experts, which Kigali denies.

Authorities in Goma in eastern DRC have clashed with demonstrators on Wednesday.

Around one hundred demonstrators gathered to demand the withdrawal of the East African Community (EAC) forces deployed to fight armed groups in the east of the country.

The regional force consists of hundreds of Kenyan and Burundian soldiers.

Another 750 soldiers from South Sudan will be joining them soon.

"The EAC Kenyan forces, ... we don't want these people to stay in our country as tourists. They came to help us, but until now they are doing tourism in our country. That is why today we are saying that they should go home, because we do not want to stay with tourists in our country", said demonstrator Gloire Bagaya.

Frustration is mounting after the Kenyan military organised ceremonies to mark the withdrawal of the M23 rebels, and for the EAC to take back control, in two villages north of Goma in late December and early January.

Another demonstrator, Lumumba Mumbere, added:

"We demonstrated today to push the EAC force to launch offensives as stated in the Luanda agreement. Unfortunately, the unprofessionalism of our Police, especially the General of the Police, they came and violently attacked us".

Since the end of October and despite declarations of ceasefire and withdrawal of its troops, the M23 continues to confront the Congolese army and other armed groups.

The East African Community deployed a regional force for the first time into eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2022. Just over a year later, the troops have started withdrawing amid tension with the host state. We asked Jenna Russo, who has covered the conflict and interventions in the DRC for more than a decade, what happened with the regional force and where the DRC goes from here.

What was the mandate of the East African Community’s intervention in the DRC?

The July 2022 decision to deploy an East African Community Regional Force to eastern DRC was prompted by renewed violence from the armed group, M23.

However, the scope of the force’s mandate has been a point of contention between the East African Community and the Congolese government. According to the regional bloc, the regional force was to oversee the withdrawal of armed groups – including M23 – from areas in eastern DRC. There are estimated to be more than 120 armed groups in this region. It was also to ensure that a ceasefire negotiated in December 2022 was observed.

The Congolese government wanted a more assertive posture, but the regional force has refused to engage in offensive operations.

It’s not clear how the two parties came to interpret the force’s mandate so differently, and this has been a major point of contention throughout its deployment.

What were the force’s challenges and achievements?

It’s much easier to speak of the force’s challenges than its achievements, which have been limited. It did experience some early victories, in particular the December 2022 ceasefire that included 53 armed groups. However, these and other efforts have been largely ineffective, with violence growing over the past year. And M23, the principal target of the intervention, has taken over new areas in the eastern region, including some where the east African troops were stationed.

It’s not only the DRC government that has been critical of the east African regional force. Many community members have expressed their anger at the force’s lack of effectiveness. In some cases, this has led to riots and outbreaks of violence against the force.

There is also an overall lack of trust in foreign forces, given the history of military and economic meddling by the DRC’s neighbours. The exploitation of the DRC’s natural resources by regional actors has been well documented. Further, some members of the East African Community Regional Force, including Burundi and Uganda, have illegally occupied areas of DRC territory.

Frustrations are also high over continued insecurity following years of intervention, including nearly 25 years of UN peacekeeping in the country. Yet, violence continues to grow, with more than six million people currently displaced in the east.

The military presence of the east African force was intended to complement a political process that also involved the regional bloc’s leadership. However, this political process has stalled amid mounting tension between the DRC and Rwanda. Accusations of Rwanda’s support for M23 remain a crucial point of discord between the two countries. Rwanda officially denies these accusations.

While the East African Community has expressed its intention to remain engaged politically even after its troops withdraw, overcoming regional political tensions remains a major obstacle.

What prompted the exit from the DRC?

After just over a year, the DRC government decided not to renew the mandate of the East African Community Regional Force past its 8 December 2023 expiration. President Felix Tshisekedi has accused the force of not only being ineffective but even of colluding with rebels.

The more likely reason for the force’s exit, however, is Tshisekedi’s dissatisfaction with its unwillingness to use proactive force against M23. This posture would entail the force undertaking offensive operations to neutralise non-state groups in partnership with government forces.

Similar frustrations have been directed at the UN peacekeeping operation, which also begins its drawing down in December 2023. While most of the benchmarks identified for the UN mission’s withdrawal have not been met, the government has made it clear the mission is no longer welcome in the country. In the eyes of the government and many community members, if foreign forces cannot tamp down non-state armed groups, they should leave the country.

What comes next?

Though the east African force and UN peacekeepers will begin leaving the country this month, this is not the end of foreign forces in the DRC. The Southern African Development Community, which the DRC is a part of, has agreed to provide troops. While the exact timing of their deployment has not yet been specified, it may correspond with the east African force’s withdrawal to ensure continuity of presence.

Underpinning the southern African deployment is the DRC’s renewed hope that the force will provide more robust operations. Tshisekedi noted that this regional bloc had resolved to help the DRC “annihilate” its enemies. The country’s deputy prime minister for foreign affairs, Christophe Lutundula, similarly stated that the force would

support the Congolese army in fighting and eradicating the M23 and other armed groups.

Even if southern African forces are willing to engage offensively, the chances of them facilitating longer term peace in the country are small.

This is because such operations rest on the DRC government’s flawed assumption that it can achieve peace through sheer military force. The lack of sustained political engagement by the main parties to the conflict has undermined numerous attempts at peace.

The DRC is not the only accountable party in this situation – Rwanda carries its fair share of responsibility. But unless the government can facilitate a viable political process, more boots on the ground – whether international, regional or bilateral – are unlikely to bring the peace that the Congolese people seek.

A first batch of South Sudanese soldiers arrived in Goma, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo on Sunday (Apr. 2nd).

The group of at least 45 soldiers is joining a regional military force in the region wracked by the M23 rebellion.

The seven-nation East African Community (EAC) military force was created last June. It is due to oversee the withdrawal of M23 fighters from eastern DRC.

Much of the region is plagued by dozens of armed groups, a legacy of regional wars that flared in the 1990s and 2000s.

Since re-emerging from dormancy in late 2021, M23 rebels have captured swathes of territory in North Kivu province and advanced within several dozen kilometres of its capital Goma.

Several regional initiatives intended to defuse the conflict such as ceasefires have failed to materialize.

March 30 was supposed to mark the end of the withdrawal of "all armed groups", according to a timetable adopted in mid-February by the EAC.

Kinshasa accused Rwanda of using refugees for political purposes on Wednesday, after its neighbour said it would no longer take in people fleeing violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame said Monday that his country "cannot keep hosting refugees" -- stoking already high tensions between the two countries.

The spokesman for the Congolese government said the remarks by Rwanda's President proved that human rights were of no value to him.

He accused Kigali of blackmailing the international community by using refugees for political purposes.

Patrick Muyaya said even though President Kagame had attempted to walk back on his remarks on the subject, he had "revealed his true intentions".

More than 70,000 Congolese have crossed to Rwanda, fleeing a conflict between the government and the M23 rebels, which the international community says is supported by Rwanda. Kigali denies the claim.

Eastern Congo is scarred by dozens of conflicts, mostly over mineral resources.

GOMA, Congo (AP) — One of eastern Congo’s most active rebel groups is attacking a community considered the last line of defense before the region’s largest city of Goma, fleeing residents said Wednesday, even as the rebels claimed they had no intention to seize it again.

The M23 rebels in a statement, however, warned that “attacks targeting our forces and/or indiscriminate shelling of civilian population will be dealt with at their source.” The group rose to prominence a decade ago by seizing Goma, an important base for Congolese forces and for humanitarian workers.

The M23, with alleged ties to Rwanda, detonated explosives in North Kivu’s Sake city 27 kilometers (16 miles) from Goma, residents said as they hurried from fighting between the rebels and security forces.

“Bombs are being dropped in the city,” said a resident, Alain Bauma. “We are fleeing but we don’t know where we are going to live.”

Carrying bedrolls, babies and other belongings, hundreds of people marched in the heat along a narrow roadway clogged with banged-up trucks and vans, in flight once again from the unrest that has gripped eastern Congo for decades.

An aid worker in Sake, Marc Sere, said another aid worker was killed in Wednesday’s bombing and called for urgent support.

“Humanitarians had to stop actions in this city for security reasons because bombs were falling at any time,” Sere said.

At least 70% of Sake residents have fled to Goma as rebels continue to advance, said civil society leader Leopold Muisha, who reported four deaths and 25 people injured in recent days.

“The rebels are getting closer and closer to Sake (and) the population no longer feels safe,” Muisha said. “We are in real danger.”

Far from Congo’s capital of Kinshasa, eastern Congo has long been overrun by more than 120 armed groups seeking a share of the region’s gold and other resources as they carry out mass killings.

Locals say the deadly unrest has worsened in recent weeks. Several armed groups have intensified attacks on civilians and tried to seize more territory as the United Nations and regional peacekeepers begin to withdraw at the government’s request. Peacekeepers have been accused of failing to stop attacks on civilians.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, who was reelected in December, has struggled to end the violence despite promises to do so. He accuses neighboring Rwanda of providing military support to the M23 rebels, a claim supported by the United Nations experts but denied by Rwanda.

Meanwhile, to the north in Ituri province, Islamic State-linked Allied Democratic Forces rebels attacked Manziya and Banzunzuwa villages late Tuesday, killing at least 13 people with several others missing, according to Kitsa Masikini, leader of the Ituri civil society group.

The vast unrest has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with at least 6.9 million people displaced as of October. Many of those displaced are beyond the reach of aid in remote areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

GOMA, Congo (AP) — A rebel group linked with neighboring Rwanda seized more territory Friday, threatening supply routes to the regional capital, as fighting intensified in conflict-ridden east Congo, local residents and aid workers said.

As M23 rebels captured the village of Mushaki in North Kivu province after more than two days of fighting with government forces and militias, civilians — including refugees from other areas — fled.

Fighting in eastern Congo has been simmering for decades as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources — while others try to defend their communities. But it spiked in late 2021 when M23, which was largely dormant for nearly a decade, resurfaced and started capturing territory.

M23 rose to prominence 10 years ago when its fighters seized Goma, eastern Congo’s largest city on the border with Rwanda. It derives its name from a March 23, 2009, peace deal, which it accuses the Congo government of not implementing.

The capture of Mushaki threatens to cut off transport into the regional capital Goma, an analyst said.

“The main supply routes into Goma look increasingly tenuous and capturing towns on major roads will bring in more tax revenue for M23 helping further offensives,” said Benjamin Hunter, Africa analyst for Verisk Maplecroft a risk assessment firm.

For months Congo has accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 group and powerful voices in the West back that assertion — which Rwanda denies. Earlier this month regional heads of state urged an immediate cease-fire by all parties and sought more troops for a regional force sent to eastern Congo last year.

But external pressure is yielding little as fighting intensifies and expands with both sides blaming the other.

Congo’s army is respecting the ceasefire and only responds to attacks when the Rwandan army and M23 try to infiltrate its positions, said Lt. Col. Guillaume Ndjike, spokesman for the army in the east.

M23 political spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka said the rebels are defending themselves against the government and a coalition of armed groups who use attack helicopters and heavy artillery to “bomb indiscriminately heavily populated areas under M23 control.”

Meanwhile civilians are bearing the brunt of the fighting. Some 5.5 million people are internally displaced in eastern Congo, according to the United Nations, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times.

“I had just fled to Karuba, now I’ve run away again. We are under fire here,” Pierre Nsabimana, a Mushaki resident told the Associated Press by phone after fleeing the village.

Aid groups say villagers can’t be used as bargaining chips.

“The civilian population is this region (is) exhausted economically and traumatized emotionally. They deserve peace,” said Caitlin Brady, director for Congo at the Norwegian Refugee Council.

Coltan: Rwanda leads exports, surpassing DRC

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda stand out as the world's top two exporters of coltan, a crucial mineral for the electronics industry that also fuels disputes between the two countries. According to Ecofin Agency, in 2023, coltan exports from the DRC totaled 1,918 tons, compared to 2,070 tons for Rwanda.

Despite its vast reserves, the DRC has seen its position challenged since 2014, engaging in fierce rivalry with its Rwandan neighbor. The lack of traceability and the persistence of smuggling raise questions about the ethics of the origin of Rwandan coltan, highlighting challenges related to natural resource governance and multinational responsibility.

Although Rwanda denies accusations of plundering Congo's resources, President Paul Kagame has acknowledged that his country serves as a hub for the smuggling of Congolese minerals, suggesting that the international community is complicit in distorting the global supply chain for the mineral.

As Rwanda's rise in coltan exports underscores the urgent need to enhance transparency and combat smuggling, international financial expert Junior Mbuyi believes this situation stems from illegal exploitation of coltan from eastern DRC by Rwanda, with the tacit support of certain international powers.

He calls for awareness from the international community to end this complicity. Furthermore, Mbuyi believes that the DRC and Rwanda must resolve their disputes through economic solutions.

Tanzania: technology simplifying tourism

Although Tanzania boasts remarkable tourist sites, high costs limit access for many residents. Therefore, a local company has developed a digital solution to facilitate payments and boost tourism.

Purple tea promises economic growth for Kenya, boosting companies like Gatura Greens, a leader in the local industry, to expand their presence in foreign markets with government support.

Will Félix Tshisekedi deliver war or peace for DR Congo and Rwanda?

20 January 2024 Share Save Basillioh Rukanga BBC News, Nairobi Share Save

AFP

On Saturday, Félix Tshisekedi was sworn in for a second term as president of the Democratic Republic of Congo following a chaotic, disputed election.

He has another five years to improve the fortunes of a nation where more than 70% of people live in extreme poverty and decades of conflict have plagued the lives of millions.

So can Mr Tshisekedi bring that long yearned-for peace to DR Congo? Or have heightened violence and the president's campaign pledge to go to war with neighbouring Rwanda ruined any chances of that?

During both of his presidential campaigns, Mr Tshisekedi has vowed to tackle the unrest in eastern DR Congo.

Dozens of armed groups - including the notorious M23 - battle for control of land, and the region's abundant minerals, which include gold, diamonds and cobalt, essential for batteries in mobile phones and electric cars.

Last year, conflict between the groups flared after a months-long lull and the number of people forced to flee their homes reached a record 6.9 million, according to the UN.

To bring all this to an end, Mr Tshisekedi needs to reshift his focus from "short-term" military initiatives to lasting solutions, Richard Moncrieff, Great Lakes Project director at the International Crisis Group (ICG), tells the BBC.

AFP Mr Tshisekedi said the Congolese people had given him an "unequivocal" mandate

President Tshisekedi and other African leaders had started negotiations - known as the Nairobi and Luanda processes - in an attempt to ease DR Congo's insecurity through military and political strategies. However, these talks appear to have stalled.

The Congolese president hasn't paid keen attention to any of the peace processes, Mr Moncrieff argues, adding: "He needs to build for the long term in terms of reforming his security sector… and not place so much trust in very, very unreliable short-term solutions."

Military initiatives taken by the president in his first term include declaring a state of siege in the provinces of Ituri and North Kivu, in 2021.

He attempted to restore order by appointing military leaders to replace the civil administration in the areas.

Additionally, the president pushed for a recruitment drive that led to thousands of young people joining the army, while launching a disarmament operation aimed at reintegrating members of armed groups into civilian life.

Critics point out that these initiatives have failed to reduce fighting in the east, even though Mr Tshisekedi insists they have borne fruit.

He told MPs in November there had been a "reduction of cross-border mining and customs fraud which fuels conflicts", as well as an improvement in intercommunity tensions and "the reestablishment of state authority".

The president has also said getting rid of an East African force set up to curb DR Congo's conflict, and replacing it with a southern African one, will help to reduce insecurity.

In October 2023, DR Congo's government said it would not extend the East Africa Community (EAC) Regional Force's mandate after months of Kinshasa complaining about the troops' ineffectiveness.

Last month, the Congolese foreign minister said troops from the southern African bloc Sadc had been given the mandate "to support the Congolese army in fighting and eradicating the M23 and other armed groups that continue to disrupt peace and security".

AFP Attacks by armed groups in DR Congo's east have forced millions of people from their homes

It remains to be seen whether Sadc can contain DR Congo's multiplicity of militias, which the forces before them, including the UN peacekeepers who have been in the country since 1999, have failed to do.

The UN mission, known as Monusco, is set to complete its withdrawal from DR Congo at the end of this year - after President Tshisekedi's government deemed them to be ineffective.

Alongside cutting ties with forces from the UN and EAC, President Tshisekedi has threatened to go to war with Rwanda.

"If you re-elect me and Rwanda persists… I will request parliament and Congress to authorise a declaration of war. We will march on Kigali," he said in December, in his final campaign rally.

He accuses Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebel group. A UN group of experts made a similar observation in a 2023 report, with the US backing its findings.

Rwanda has always denied the claim and accuses its neighbour of backing Hutu rebels who stage attacks in Rwanda.

President Tshisekedi has threatened to attack Rwanda a number of times before, but has not yet followed through. Many believe these pledges were simply a bid for the nationalist vote.

Following Mr Tshisekedi's most recent pledge, Rwandan President Paul Kagame said anyone who wished for his country's destruction "will experience it instead".

Mr Kagame's words indicate Rwanda would respond with force to any "march on Kigali" and President Tshisekedi would not only have failed to bring peace to DR Congo, but would have drawn more violence to his own country.

And Rwanda's army is one of the most respected in Africa, while DR Congo's is notorious for corruption and ill-discipline.

But having made the threat, Mr Tshisekedi "will find it difficult to row back from the bellicose rhetoric that he used in the election campaign", Mr Moncrieff said.

In DR Congo, peace does not only mean the defeat of M23 and its fellow armed groups. The Congolese people will also expect their president to facilitate dialogue which addresses disputes between the nation's numerous ethnic groups, which past leaders have not successfully tackled.

He must also deal with the political row caused by the disputed elections.

Ahead of the inauguration, three opposition leaders and presidential candidates who lost out to Mr Tshisekedi called for protests during the ceremony.

DR Congo election: 'We would vote for peace - if we had a vote'

14 December 2023 Share Save Mercy Juma in Goma & Samba Cyuzuzo in Nairobi BBC News Share Save

BBC

After heavily armed rebels surrounded her small village in eastern Democratic Republic Congo, Musa Bi walked for seven days with six young children until she reached a UN-run refugee camp.

The 42-year-old is filled with worry, with no idea of the fate of her husband and two other children, as the family was separated in the chaos that followed the advance by the M23 rebels.

She has little thought for the 20 December presidential election - and while the conflict taking place around her may be dominating the campaign, there will be no voting in several areas of the North Kivu province where she lives because of the unrest.

"M23 came. They were fighting with our [government] soldiers. We started running and those who could not run away, they were killed," she tells the BBC.

Fortunate to survive, Mrs Bi and her children slept in other villages until they reached the Bushagala camp only to be once more spending the nights out in the open, often in the rain.

When the BBC met them, they had been at the camp at the base of the Mount Nyiragongo volcano for six days, waiting for the UN refugee agency to register them so they get a tent - and food rations.

But the agency is so overwhelmed by the influx of those fleeing - 700 to 1,000 each day - that Mrs Bi is patiently waiting her turn, while relying on those already registered to share their food - normally made of sorghum and millet flour - with her and her little ones.

The UN estimates that nearly seven million people are internally displaced in DR Congo, the highest number on record.

Yet at Mrs Bi's village near the town of Masisi, her family was self-sufficient, growing food on their nearby farm - until they were driven out by M23, who are on the offensive again as a regional ceasefire initiative flounders.

The fighters, initially Congolese army deserters, accuse the government of marginalising the country's ethnic Tutsi minority and refusing to negotiate with them. They regard the verdant hills around Masisi as their true homeland.

AFP President Tshisekedi held an election rally over the weekend in Goma, where several anti-UN protests have been held

President Félix Tshisekedi, who is seeking a second five-year term, has been whipping up nationalist fervour by casting the rebels as a front for what he calls the "expansionist aims" of neighbouring Rwanda - and going as far as to compare its president to Germany's World War Two leader.

"I'm going to address Rwandan President Paul Kagame and tell him this: since he wanted to behave like Adolf Hitler by having expansionist aims, I promise he will end up like Adolf Hitler," Mr Tshisekedi said at an election rally in the east on Friday.

"However, he [has] met his match, someone who is determined to stop him and protect his country."

Mr Kagame has not responded, but a Rwandan government spokeswoman said such comments were "a loud and clear threat".

AFP M23 rebels, made up of some Congolese army deserters, are well equipped and say they represent the country's Tutsi minority

Rwanda has always denied backing the M23, but for many years has criticised the Congolese authorities for failing to disarm ethnic Hutu rebels - some of whom are linked to the Rwandan genocide in 1994.

Hundreds of militias proliferate in the mineral-rich region, where the military has failed to get a grip on security for the last three decades. All armed groups eye the profits as the metals mined end up in products such as mobile phones, cars, planes and jewellery.

In a further sign of nationalist fervour ahead of the election, Mr Tshisekedi has booted out an East African peacekeeping force - about a year after he welcomed it.

Earlier he ordered the withdrawal of the UN mission, known by its acronym Monusco, which has deployed more than 17,000 personnel, including 12,000 soldiers.

This does not surprise the commander of the UN troops, who acknowledges that they have failed to protect people like Mrs Bi from the advancing rebels.

"When people say Monusco was not doing their job sometimes, they are not wrong, we must accept that," says Lieutenant General Otávio Rodrigues de Miranda Filho of Brazil.

"The biggest challenge when I arrived here was to change the mindset of my troops. To motivate them and to make them understand that we have to be much more proactive and effective. Otherwise we lose the confidence of the population."

The UN withdrawal from eastern DR Congo could take years

Mr Tshisekedi is frustrated that neither force has taken a more robust approach to the M23, which is now only around 35km (20 miles) from Goma, the main city in the east with a population of about one million, over which Mt Nyiragongo looms.

This has raised the prospect of Goma falling to the rebels, just as it did briefly a decade ago. This gave way to a regional peace deal and the formation of a UN intervention brigade, made up of troops from the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), to bring the M23 to heel and disarm them.

More about the DR Congo election:

The fighters eventually moved into camps, mainly in Uganda. They began regrouping two years ago at the foot of the mountains that stretch into Rwanda and Uganda - world famous for their gorillas and volcanoes - after complaints that the deal was not being honoured.

The fall of Mrs Bi's village - and the nearby town of Masisi - shows the renewed strength of the rebels.

With the DR Congo army in no position to fight them on its own, Mr Tshisekedi sees Sadc as his best bet, and has asked the regional group for help, given their soldiers' previous success.

The 16-member bloc - which includes South Africa, Tanzania and Angola - has agreed to send troops as part of a separate tougher force, though details are sketchy and it is unclear when it will arrive.

Mr Tshisekedi's decision to order the UN force to withdraw follows several big protests against it in Goma over its failure to beat back the rebels.

But some people the BBC spoke to said their withdrawal would leave them with no protection at all.

"Any time the rebels attack our villages and farms, it is the Monusco bases where we run to, for protection," says Elizabeth Ssebazungu from the Shasha camp about 30km west of Goma.

However, their exit will not be immediate and will take place in phases, possibly over several years.

In January, Pakistani troops will start pulling out of South Kivu province, something that should take four months.

"There is no established time for the second and third phase, until now. The government asked us to keep the timelines open," Gen Otávio says.

Between 700 and 1,000 flee to Bushagala camp each day

This is something many local people do not realise, especially as campaigning politicians riding the wave of anti-UN sentiment suggest it is imminent.

For Mrs Bi, it all feels piecemeal, while their plight continues to be ignored - despite election promises.

Her view is echoed by other refugees at Bushagala camp, including Uzima Sadro, who recently lost his farm to M23 rebels.

"Our struggles are not new. They are the same, just worse," he says.

"The politicians really do not care about us and have failed to bring peace, which is what we want."

Apple accused of using conflict minerals

AFP The mineral-rich east of DR Congo has seen years of conflict often fuelled by what lies underneath the ground

The Democratic Republic of Congo has filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using conflict minerals. Acting on behalf of the Congolese government, lawyers have argued that Apple is complicit in crimes committed by armed groups that control some of the mines in the east of DR Congo. Apple has said it "strongly disputes" the claims and that it is "deeply committed to responsible sourcing" of minerals. The authorities in France and Belgium will now look at whether there is enough evidence to take the legal action further.

In a statement, the lawyers for the DR Congo talked about Apple's supply chain being contaminated with "blood minerals". They allege that the tin, tantalum and tungsten is taken from conflict areas and then "laundered through international supply chains". "These activities have fuelled a cycle of violence and conflict by financing militias and terrorist groups and have contributed to forced child labour and environmental devastation." Apple rejected the accusations saying it holds its "suppliers to the highest standards in industry". A spokesman told the BBC: "As conflict in the region escalated earlier this year we notified our suppliers that their smelters and refiners must suspend sourcing tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold from the DRC and Rwanda. "We took this action because we were concerned it was no longer possible for independent auditors or industry certification mechanisms to perform the due diligence required to meet our high standards." The east of DR Congo is a major source of minerals and the global thirst for them has fuelled wars there for decades. Rights groups have long alleged that large quantities of minerals from legitimate mines, as well as from facilities run by armed groups, are transported to neighbouring Rwanda and end up in our phones and computers. Rwanda has in the past described the Congolese government's legal action against Apple as a media stunt. It has denied selling any conflict minerals to the tech company.

BBC visits mpox clinic as WHO says DR Congo cases 'plateauing'

22 November 2024 Share Save Anne Soy Senior Africa correspondent, BBC News Share Save

BBC Nurse Jackson Murhula says Lwiro clinic is only receiving two or three mpox cases a day at the moment

Medics at the epicentre of the mpox outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have told the BBC there has been a notable reduction in new infections since the first batch of vaccines were rolled out last month. The UN World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed to the BBC that new cases appeared to be "plateauing" in DR Congo, but cautioned that it was too early to tell the impact of vaccinations. Mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - is a highly contagious disease and is suspected to have killed at least 900 people in DR Congo this year. WHO officials confirmed mpox remains a global public health emergency, the highest alert for any major outbreak.

Other public health experts in Africa have warned the disease is still spreading, with 19 countries in the continent reporting infections. What is mpox and how is it spread?

Nurses working in fear: BBC visits mpox epicentre In September the BBC visited a clinic in Lwiro, a rural area about an hour's drive outside the city of Bukavu in DR Congo's eastern province of South Kivu. The cases there have been linked to a relatively new and more severe strain of mpox known as Clade 1b, which appears to spread more easily and cause more serious disease. Two months ago, we found the community hospital overwhelmed - with long queues of infected patients, many forced to share beds or mattresses on the floor and doctors struggling to cope with the numbers arriving each day. "Right now, we can't have more than 60 patients in the hospital," nurse Emmanuel Fikiri, who has been on the front line of the mpox crisis for months, told the BBC this week. "This is due to the fact that there has been an improvement, there has been vaccination against mpox and there has been support from several partners who have enabled us to take care of the patients," he said. When Mr Fikiri last spoke to the BBC he could only talk briefly as he rushed off to treat some of the nearly 200 patients who were then crammed into the wards. But he is now much more optimistic about the situation given that vaccine take up in the community has been high - meaning new infections appear to have dropped dramatically. Indeed when a BBC producer visited the Lwiro hospital earlier this week we found a much calmer scene: the long queues had gone and there were some empty beds in the children's ward.

Julienne Mwinja says her three-year-old son was admitted a week ago with mpox symptoms

DR Congo started its mpox vaccination programme in October after taking delivery of 265,000 doses donated by the international community. More than 50,000 people have been vaccinated so far - with the rollout focused on communities most at risk, including towns and villages in the eastern DR Congo. But experts have noted that mpox appears to be disproportionately affecting children in DR Congo - and they are not being vaccinated. It was only this week that the WHO authorised a vaccine expected from Japan for children. "Out of the people affected, about 30% are children," Dr Jean Kaseya, head of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), told the BBC - explaining that children were "also vectors of transmission". Another nurse at the Lwiro clinic, Jackson Murhula, warned that it was too early to say for sure the disease in the community had been beaten - though he too was happy to see things easing. "Lately it's started to slow down, because at the beginning we were receiving 10 or 15 new cases a day, but now we're only receiving two or three cases a day," he said. "We can't confirm that we've totally stabilised the disease, because cases are still coming in, but it's not like before." Among the children being treated this week is three-year-old Atukuzwe Banissa. He groans in pain, his eyes shut and face covered in whitish spots left behind by the healing sores. His mother, 25-year-old Julienne Mwinja, says his symptoms began with teary eyes. She administered eye drops, but within a day, the little boy developed sores in his mouth, face and body. "He looked like he'd been scalded by hot water," the mother of three told the BBC. That is when she brought him to Lwiro hospital where he was admitted for more than a week. For the medics at Lwrio, it is heartening that people are now tending to come to the clinic as soon as they get symptoms rather than first going to traditional healers.

This ward was packed when the BBC visited Lwiro community hospital in September

Dr Samuel Boland, WHO incident manager for mpox, told the BBC that more than 96% of all new mpox cases were currently in DR Congo, Uganda and Rwanda. While confirming DR Congo had turned a corner, he warned it was too soon to be sure the outbreak was over. "In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we've actually seen, to some extent, a plateauing in the number of mpox cases, but collectively, it still is a very significantly affected country globally," he said. In fact, more than 90% of those who have died of mpox worldwide this year have been in DR Congo. Although exact figures are unknown as only 77 deaths have been confirmed in the laboratory as there are not many testing centres available in certain areas of the continent. "And so there remains a very, very strong need to make sure that we continue intervening at pace and at scale, even in places where we see that there may not be an escalation of cases at this moment in time," Dr Boland said. "Though overall, we might see a shift in the transmission in some places, we do again, still see escalation in others - and so we're not out of the woods yet." Vaccination programmes have started elsewhere in Africa too, including in Nigeria and DR Congo’s neighbour Rwanda. Dr Kaseya said the Africa CDC had not seen any notable changes week-on-week over the past month in the DR Congo and warned that it was too early to say the mpox outbreak was under control. With every effort to conduct vaccinations, reinforce surveillance and laboratory systems "maybe by mid-January to February we’ll start to see a decrease in the cases of infection and deaths". WHO Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus said there is an urgent need for a coordinated global response. The outbreak has now spread beyond Africa, with cases reported in the UK, US, Sweden, India, Germany, Thailand and Pakistan.

The Democratic Republic of Congo army says it has quashed an attempted coup against President Felix Tshisekedi in the capital Kinshasa involving Congolese and foreign fighters. DR Congo army spokesperson Brig Gen Sylavin Ekenge said that 50 suspects, including three Americans and a naturalised British citizen have been detained. He previously said on the state-run broadcaster RTNC TV that the "situation is now under control". His statement comes hours after armed men attacked the house of Vital Kamerhe, the former chief of staff and close ally of President Tshisekedi early on Sunday morning.

Witnesses say a group of about 20 assailants in army uniform attacked the residence and an exchange of gunfire followed. Two guards and an assailant were killed in the attack on Mr Kamerhe's house, his spokesman and the Japanese ambassador said in posts on X. The men also occupied the Palais de la Nation, the office of the President of the Republic which is located in the city centre, a place highly secured by the Republican Guard. Japan's ambassador in the Congolese capital has warned nationals not to go out. President Tshisekedi has not made any public comment on the situation so far. Local media reports said the assailants were members of the New Zaire Movement linked to formerly exiled DR Congo politician Christian Malanga, who has acquired American citizenship.

Mr Malanga was shot dead at the presidential palace after he resisted arrest by security forces, Mr Ekenge said. His son, Marcel Malanga, was among the three American nationals arrested over the alleged coup attempt.

The US ambassador to DR Congo Lucy Tamlyn said she was “shocked” by reports that Americans may have participated in the coup attempt. “Rest assured that we will cooperate with the DR Congo authorities to the fullest extent possible as they investigate these criminal acts and hold accountable any US citizen involved,” Ms Tamlyn said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). African Union chair Moussa Faki said he "strongly condemns" the coup attempt and welcomed the response of the country's defence and security forces. "He takes this opportunity to condemn any use of force to change the constitutional order in any African state whatsoever."

The BBC has seen a video of Mr Malanga saying in Lingala, a local language: “We the military are tired, we cannot march together with Vital Kamerhe and President Félix Tshisekedi." President Tshisekedi was re-elected for a second term in disputed elections last year in December. He won about 78% of the vote. Nearly 20 people were killed in election-related violence in the run-up to the vote.

DR Congo is a country with vast mineral wealth and a huge population, but despite this, life has not improved for most people, with conflict, corruption and poor governance persisting. Much of the country's natural resources lie in the east where violence still rages despite Mr Tshisekedi's attempts to deal with the situation by imposing a state of siege, ceasefire deals and bringing in regional troops.

DR Congo floods: Chaos in Kinshasa as river rises to near-record level

12 January 2024 Share Save Wedaeli Chibelushi & Chinois Mbelechi Msoshi BBC News, London and Kinshasa Share Save

Getty Images Residents in Kinshasa have been using canoes on the city's flooded roads

Floods have wreaked chaos in Kinshasa - the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo - with water pouring into homes and residents navigating submerged roads via canoe.

The overflowing River Congo, passing through much of the country, has also swamped places outside the capital.

The vast, vital waterway has reached its highest level in six decades.

More than 300 people have died in floods over the past months, officials say.

On Thursday, residents in the impoverished megacity of Kinshasa told the BBC how "schools, hospitals and churches" have been washed away.

"I had lived here with my relatives... I have lost everything," Jonas Mungindami said.

Similarly, Denise Tuzola said her house is now "full of water".

BBC News Denise Tuzola's neighbourhood has been inundated with floodwater.

"There is no church here any more and there is no way for the children to go to school," she added.

Kinshasa is home to several small rivers and streams, which often double as open sewers. Many have now overflowed.

On one flooded street, a man waded through through thigh-level water, hauling a canoe full of passengers behind him. Trucks drove cautiously through the same waters, while dozens of discarded bottles bob on the surface.

The RVF, the agency overseeing DR Congo's waterways, sounded the alarm in late December.

It warned that heavy rains would cause "exceptional flooding" around the Kinshasa area.

By this point, provinces such as Mongala and Ituri had already faced serious flooding.

In Kinshasa, flooding is common but this year the River Congo has risen just shy of 6.26 metres, the level reached during record flooding in 1961.

Further upstream, in the city of Kisangani, the mayor said that over 200 houses have been submerged.

The Congo River has also caused turmoil in Congo-Brazzaville, a nation that borders DR Congo.

Flooding there has impacted more than 336,000 people and 34 health facilities, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.

Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.

Just over a year ago, floods in Kinshasa left more than 120 people dead.

DR Congo violence: Panic in Goma as M23 rebels advance

11 February 2024 Share Save Samba Cyuzuzo & Mayeni Jones BBC Great Lakes & BBC News Share Save

EPA Goma's population has swelled in recent days as people arrive by motorbike and foot fleeing advancing fighters

Emile Bolingo is not sure how long he and other residents of Goma, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, can hold out.

This major city in the region, with about two million people, has been cut off from the farms that feed it for several days.

It is the latest episode in a resurgence of fighting that has seen tens of thousands added to the nearly seven million who have been forced from their homes in the country because of multiple conflicts.

Rebels from the ethnic Tutsi-led M23 movement are blocking the two main roads into Goma from the north and the west and preventing produce from getting through.

"We are scared of going hungry if the [Congolese army] do not liberate any of the main roads very soon. You can feel the panic here… people are very scared," Mr Bolingo told the BBC.

Goma's population has swelled in recent days with people running from the advancing fighters.

Glody Murhabazi Mundeke Kandundao, a motorbike taxi rider, has just undergone surgery after a bomb blast

Sake, a town 25km (15 miles) north-west of Goma, came under attack on Wednesday.

"I sustained a pelvic injury caused by shrapnel," Mundeke Kandundao told the BBC from his hospital bed in Goma where he has undergone surgery.

The 25-year-old motorbike taxi driver said a shell was launched by the rebels from a hill overlooking the town on Wednesday.

"I was standing behind a cabin and there were a lot of other people there and that's where it exploded," he said.

"We are scared because you know the war goes on and on, it is meaningless. We are waiting to see if it ends so that we can go back to our homes."

Laurent Cresci, from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told the BBC from the state-run Bethsaida Hospital in Goma that patient numbers had surged on Wednesday: "It was really a mass casualty. We were before 80 patients in our ward, and now we have 130 patients so it's really hard to manage."

For many people it is a tragic case of déjà vu.

"For how long shall we live like this? Every now and then we keep fleeing," Pascal Bashali told the BBC after he had arrived in Goma. People are streaming in by foot, on motorbikes and mini buses.

Aline Ombeni said she was distraught on her arrival in the city: "We have fled empty-handed just as you are seeing us - no food, no clothes we need help with shelter and food."

AFP M23 fighters are well equipped, but the group denies being a Rwanda proxy

As the conflict edges closer, it brings back memories of 2012 when the rebels occupied the lakeside city for 10 days before abandoning it following international pressure.

The M23, formed as an offshoot of another rebel group, began operating in 2012 ostensibly to protect the Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo which had long complained of persecution and discrimination. UN experts have said that the group is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which is also led by Tutsis, something that Kigali has consistently denied.

"We all know that the reason of this war is economic. Rwanda is continuing... for the past 25 years… looting our mineral resources," Congolese Communications Minister Patrick Muyaya told the BBC, urging the UK to use its influence with Rwanda to ease the situation.

There are now fears that the M23 - by far the most organised, disciplined and well-equipped of the many militia groups in the region - could capture Goma once again.

Recently re-elected Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi last year said that "Congolese need to learn to trust us, Goma will never fall". He repeated the promise, in the city itself, during the election campaign in December.

Within reach of major mining towns supplying metals and minerals in high demand such as gold, tin and coltan, Goma has become a vital economic hub. Its road and air transport links, and the fact that it has a huge UN peacekeeping base, has attracted a host of businesses, international organisations and diplomatic consulates.

As such, Goma is a valuable strategic target, but the M23 says it does not want to capture it and maintains it is on the defensive not offensive.

"If you see the military power of the M23, they could take Goma if they wanted to, but this could bring them many problems," said Onesphore Sematumba, a DR Congo analyst at the International Crisis Group thinktank.

The rebels may just be displaying their capabilities, and also thinking back to 2012 and the international opprobrium that followed the seizing of Goma then.

In the aftermath of its withdrawal it suffered a series of heavy defeats at the hands of the Congolese army backed by a multinational force that saw it expelled from the country. M23 fighters then agreed to be re-integrated into the army in return for promises that Tutsis would be protected.

But, in 2021, the group took up arms again, saying the promises had been broken.

It emerged from the mountain forests on the border between DR Congo, Rwanda and Uganda and edged closer to Goma taking swathes of territory.

Ceasefires have been agreed, but these have all broken down, with the government and the M23 blaming each other.

The M23 has repeatedly said it still wants peace negotiations with Kinshasa.

"We asked for the dialogue to resolve this problem peacefully," M23 spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka told the BBC. "Many cycles of war… don't resolve the root causes of conflict. The Congolese government itself doesn't want that, it wants to go on a war, and kill people even more."

President Tshisekedi has said talks are "out of question".

"One thing must be clear is that we as government, we will never negotiate with M23. M23 doesn't exist. It's Rwanda acting with its puppet," his communications minister told the BBC.

Reuters Hundreds of thousands of people have already fled their villages to live in makeshift camps; some are on the move again

Last year, an East African force, which was in DR Congo to help protect civilians and secure areas that armed groups had withdrawn from, left the country at the government's request.

Its departure in December was followed by the end of the latest ceasefire and the recent upsurge in activity by the M23.

President Tshisekedi hopes that a southern African force that recently arrived in its place will have more success as it has a mandate to attack rebel groups.

He has also asked the large UN force in the country, known as Monusco, to leave. It has become increasingly unpopular for its failure to end the conflict during its 25-year deployment.

But there are concerns that the conflict could get even worse after the Congolese president threatened in December to declare war on Rwanda if the rebels attack again.

In an apparent reply to the remarks, Rwanda's President Paul Kagame said in January that in defending his country "we will fight like people who have nothing to lose".

Meanwhile, Natàlia Torrent, from medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), has warned that the intensification of fighting in "different areas and on different fronts" since mid-January is having a devastating effect on an already vulnerable population.

"We are in an area that has been already prone to the spread of different epidemics. We have been already working in the last year on cholera or measles and we are afraid... [a] new wave of epidemics are going to surge again," she told the BBC.

Reflecting on the fighting, Goma resident Mr Bolingo added: "We are the ones who suffer."

Mr Bashali, who fled from Sake with his wife and nine children, agreed: "Men are dying, children are dying, women are dying, those fighting are dying, what for? We are praying that our country will be peaceful."

Moïse Katumbi in DR Congo: Troops surrounded poll loser's home

9 January 2024 Share Save Wycliffe Muia BBC News Share Save

Reuters Moïse Katumbi is a multi-millionaire mining magnate and popular football boss

Security forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo briefly surrounded the home of main opposition politician Moïse Katumbi, who came second in last month's disputed elections.

He was prevented from leaving his home in southern Katanga province on Monday, his spokesperson Hervé Diakesse said.

But the security forces later withdrew on the orders of a local governor.

Mr Katumbi has rejected President Félix Tshisekedi's landslide victory in last month's election as a sham.

Five other opposition leaders, including Martin Fayulu, who came third, have called for a protest march against the election results.

On Monday evening, residents of Kashobwe village were seen in social media videos trooping to Mr Katumbi's home after news spread that security forces were preventing him from leaving.

One of Mr Katumbi's relatives told French RFI news website that the home was surrounded by "heavily armed soldiers".

"We are struggling to figure out why," Mr Diakesse, told Reuters news agency.

In a bid to defuse the escalating crisis, provincial governor Jacques Kyabula Katwe ordered the security forces to leave, calling the incident a "faux pas".

He said the initial intention of the security forces was to protect Mr Katumbi's property from potential acts of vandalism.

The 20 December election was marred by widespread logistical problems, with some independent observers raising concerns about the vote.

Only one candidate has gone to court to challenge the presidential election results.

The main ones say they have no faith in the courts and have instead called for the population to "resist electoral fraud" without giving any details.

Mr Tshisekedi won about 73% of the vote, while Mr Katumbi got 18% and Mr Fayulu 5%, the election commission said.

Western governments have called for restraint amid fears of post-election violence, with the UN's top human rights official, Volker Turk, voicing alarm about rising ethnic tension.

Nearly 20 people were killed in election-related violence in the run-up to the vote.

An army colonel has been sentenced to death in the Democratic Republic of Congo for his role in the killing of more than 50 demonstrators in August. Col Mike Mikombe, the ex-commander of the elite Republican Guard in Goma city, was accused of giving orders to open fire on anti-UN protesters. His lawyers said he would appeal against the military court's ruling. This was the highest number of deaths in a crackdown on protests against UN peacekeepers in eastern DR Congo. The protesters were demanding the withdrawal of UN troops, accusing them of failing to protect civilians who have been under decades-long attacks by rebel groups in the region. The UN has almost 18,000 personnel in the country, including more than 12,000 soldiers, making it the second-largest UN mission globally.

DR Congo elections: Fayulu's supporters clash with police in Kinshasa

27 December 2023 Share Save Byobe Malenga & Emery Makumeno BBC News, Kinshasa Share Save

Getty Images The government banned the protest march organised by the opposition

Police in the Democratic Republic of Congo have clashed with opposition supporters demanding that last week's presidential poll be annulled.

Leading opposition candidates have denounced the election as a sham and have demanded a rerun.

Several people were wounded as police fired tear gas and threw stones back at protesters in the capital, Kinshasa.

The government banned the protest, saying it would not tolerate attempts to undermine the electoral process.

Election officials have so far not said exactly how many polling stations opened or how many people voted in the 20 December election.

About 44 million people were registered to vote at about 75,000 polling stations.

With just over nine million ballots counted so far, President Felix Tshisekedi is in the lead with almost 80% of the vote as he seeks a second term.

Football tycoon and mining magnate Moïse Katumbi is trailing him with about 16%.

Former oil executive Martin Fayulu, who claims he was robbed of victory in the 2018 election, is in third place with about 4%.

Mr Fayulu's supporters burnt tyres and clashed with police outside his campaign headquarters in Kinshasa.

Police took up positions on key roads in the city and thwarted an attempted march to the headquarters of the electoral commission.

Mr Fayulu said that 11 of his supporters were injured, while police reported two injuries on their side.

Getty Images Opposition supporters allege that the poll has been marred by rigging

The election was marred by logistical delays and administrative chaos, forcing voting to be extended to a second day in some parts of the country.

The opposition has also accused the electoral commission of orchestrating fraud and ballot stuffing in order to pave the way for Mr Tshisekedi to be declared the winner.

The commission has denied the allegations.

DR Congo is roughly four times the size of France, but lacks basic infrastructure. Even some of its main cities are not linked by road.

About two-thirds of the country's 100 million population live below the poverty line, earning $2.15 (£1.70) a day or less.

Voters also chose parliamentary, provincial and municipal representatives, with about 100,000 candidates in total.

The elections were not held in parts of the east because of insecurity.

Dozens of armed groups have been competing to control parts of the region, home to much of the country's vast mineral wealth.

This includes vast reserves of cobalt, a vital part of many lithium batteries, seen as essential to a future free of fossil fuels.

ICJ orders Uganda to pay $325m for DR Congo occupation

AFP Uganda worked with local militias to loot gold from Ituri

Uganda has been ordered to pay $325m (£240m) to the Democratic Republic of Congo for its role in the conflict there.

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled Uganda had violated international norms as an occupying force between 1998 and 2003.

The judges found that Uganda was responsible for the deaths of 10-15,000 people in the eastern Ituri region.

Ugandan troops were also found to have looted gold, diamonds and timber.

DR Congo had demanded $11bn but the judges dismissed several parts of the claim and decided on a far lower amount.

The ICJ ordered Uganda to pay five annual instalments of $65m between 2022 and 2026, with the first instalment due in September.

Uganda had argued that the billions demanded by DR Congo would destroy its economy. The court said its order would be "within the capacity of Uganda to pay".

The $325m covers:

$225m for damages to persons

$40m for damages to property

$60m for the looted resources

In its judgment, the court said: "The reparation awarded to the DRC for damage to persons and to property reflects the harm suffered by individuals and communities as a result of Uganda's breach of its international obligations."

DR Congo filed a case against Uganda in 1999 for acts of armed aggression committed against it and its citizens. It accused Ugandan soldiers of looting and human rights violations.

Numerous armed groups have been wreaking havoc in mineral-rich eastern DR Congo for decades. In the 1990s, troops from Uganda and Rwanda twice invaded their much larger neighbour DR Congo, working with local militias to topple the government. They argued that they had intervened to stop the conflict in DR Congo from spilling across their borders.

Uganda has dismissed the verdict as not fair. Attorney General Kiryowa Kiwanuka questioned why Ugandan troops had been "singled out" when there were many different forces involved in the conflict.

He did not say whether Uganda would pay the reparations but said it would continue to "engage with" the Congolese government to resolve the issue.

DR Congo issues death sentences for murder of UN experts

Zaida Catalan went to DR Congo to investigate abuses for the UN along with Michael Sharp (picture from 2009)

Dozens of militia members have been sentenced to death in the Democratic Republic of Congo for their involvement in the murder of two UN experts.

Swedish-Chilean Zaida Catalan and American Michael Sharp were abducted and killed in the Kasai region in 2017.

They were investigating alleged mass graves after fighting broke out between government forces and a militia group.

Their interpreter, Betu Tshintela, was also killed. Their bodies were found 16 days after being kidnapped.

Catalan had been beheaded.

The UN was shocked by the murders and at the time, and Secretary General António Guterres said the organisation "would do everything possible to ensure that justice is done".

Hundreds of people died in the conflict in Kasai which ended in 2017. Over a million people were displaced by the fighting, which began after a traditional leader, Kamwina Sapu, was killed in August 2016.

The guilty verdicts were handed down by a military court at the end of a four-year trial.

Out of the dozens of defendants, 51, almost all militia members, were sentenced to death. But as DR Congo has declared a moratorium on executions, the sentences are likely to end up being life imprisonment.

They had faced a variety of charges, from terrorism and murder to the act of a war crime through mutilation, the AFP news agency reports.

Col Jean de Dieu Mambweni, who received the 10-year sentence, was accused of violating orders. Two others - a journalist and a police officer - were acquitted.

However, Human Rights Watch says this trial has not uncovered what really happened. It wants another investigation to find out if the orders to kill the UN investigators came from higher up the military chain of command.

Mount Nyiragongo: Why DR Congo fears the explosive power of a lake

29 May 2021 Share Save Share Save

Volcanologist Dario Tedesco says that Goma is one of the most dangerous cities to live in because of natural disasters

A sinister threat is lurking beneath a lake near the city of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Scientists say underground magma has been flowing toward Lake Kivu since the deadly eruption of the nearby Mount Nyiragongo volcano on Saturday.

An eruption from under the lake could trigger the release of a lethal, suffocating cloud of gas, experts fear.

Known as a limnic eruption, this event poses a rare but potentially catastrophic risk to Goma's residents.

It would be terrible but "no-one would ever really claim they know when or if this is going to happen", science journalist and volcanologist Dr Robin George Andrews told the BBC.

Fearing this and other possible volcanic activity, tens of thousands of people have been told to evacuate Goma, leaving the city eerily deserted.

"There's a magma under the ground here in town that could erupt at any moment apparently. It's quite scary," one fleeing resident said.

Ordering the evacuation a day earlier, the military governor of North Kivu province, Ndima Kongba, said magma had been detected underneath Goma and nearby Lake Kivu.

"Right now we can't rule out an eruption on land or under the lake," Mr Kongba said.

But how do limnic eruptions happen, and what makes them so dangerous?

What is a limnic eruption?

A limnic eruption involves the release of dissolved gases that have accumulated at the depths of a lake. Gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane can seep into lakes through volcanic vents.

To trigger the release of these gases from the water, a disturbance of some kind is needed.

That disturbance could be an eruption, a landslide, an earthquake or even a small rise in the temperature of the water.

This is why scientists are worried about the magma underneath the lake.

Reuters Thousands of people have fled from Goma and areas close to Lake Kivu

In theory, the magma could heat up the water, causing the dissolved CO2 to mix rapidly with upper layers of the lake and escape into the air.

Consider the opening of a shaken-up fizzy drink as an analogy. When the lid is opened, the pressure is released, allowing the carbon dioxide to escape.

Why is it so dangerous?

High concentrations of CO2 can displace oxygen in the air and affect breathing.

Dr Andrews said Lake Kivu is estimated to contain about 300 cubic km of CO2, which is invisible, odourless, and denser than air. If there is less oxygen to breathe in the air, serious and sometimes deadly health effects can ensue.

It has happened before at a lake in Cameroon, with tragic consequences.

In 1986, Lake Nyos released dissolved CO2 into the air after a landslide. The cloud of CO2 asphyxiated an estimated 1,800 people in nearby villages.

The key difference in DR Congo, of course, is the size of the lake and the population centres around it.

Measuring about 475m (1,558ft) deep, Lake Kivu has more than twice the depth of Nyos, not to mention overall size: 2,700 sq km for lake Kivu to 1.58 sq km for Nyos.

"If there was a big underwater volcanic explosion, it could cause an eruption of all this gas that would flood the urbanised shores of Lake Kivu, which would be an incredibly dangerous thing to happen," Dr Andrews said.

What's the likelihood of it happening?

The short answer is: no-one can be certain. Not even experienced volcanologists have a clear idea.

Dr Andrews said it was "incredibly difficult" to predict what would happen in the coming days.

While scientists know magma is near Lake Kivu, they can't be sure when or if it might breach the surface, or what kind of eruption style it may cause, Dr Andrews said.

"The best that anyone can do at the moment is be really cautious. I'm really glad to see that areas are being evacuated just in case the worst happens," he said.

What other scenarios are feared?

A limnic eruption was one of three possible outcomes flagged by the Goma Volcano Observatory (OVG).

A second is another eruption at the 3,500m-high Mount Nyiragongo - one of the world's most active volcanoes.

If that were to happen, the eruption would send renewed lava flows southwards towards Goma, threatening buildings in their path.

Even though the volcano is 10km (six miles) from Goma, lava "can move as fast as a speeding car so it's very difficult to outrun", Dr Andrews said.

This would add to the devastation of Saturday's eruption, which killed at least 32 people and left thousands homeless, according to the United Nations (UN).

Reuters The eruption last Saturday displaced thousands of people

Getty Images Lava from the first eruption swallowed up large swathes of the landscape

The possible release of methane from the lake brings a third scenario into play as well.

There is a risk that methane can ignite, if it is released in high enough concentrations. For this reason, Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said it was not safe to be in Goma anymore.

"Lake Kivu is unsafe because there are vast quantities of methane gas trapped on the bottom of Lake Kivu and that could be released by the volcano and the constant earthquakes which were there all the time," Mr Egeland told the BBC on Thursday.

What's the situation on the ground in DR Congo?

About 400,000 people have fled Goma over fears of a fresh volcanic eruption, the UN said on Friday.

The international agency appealed for "urgent international assistance to avert what could be a catastrophe for children".

A BBC reporter in Goma says the city looks like a ghost town. Sake - 20km away - is full of displaced people.

Others are moving into neighbouring Rwanda, the Virunga National park and even across Lake Kivu.

Aid agencies are trying to provide food, shelter, water and sanitation.

Mount Nyiragongo: Half a million without water in DR Congo - charity

Reuters Displaced people - including children - have been seen queuing to get drinking water at a temporary camp in Sake

Nearly 500,000 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been left without clean drinking water after a volcano erupted, the charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has warned.

It says because cholera is endemic and poses a great threat there is an urgent need to provide people in the eastern city of Goma with safe drinking water.

A reservoir and pipes were damaged when Mount Nyiragongo erupted on 22 May.

Hundreds of thousands of people are still unable to return to their homes.

"We are assisting the immediate needs of displaced people, but it is not enough," said Magali Roudaut, MSF head of mission in DRC.

"We demand urgent support of other humanitarian organisations to assist people."

MSF said its teams were providing medical services in the nearby town of Sake, "where between 100,000 and 180,000 people are gathering in churches, schools, mosques, and on the streets".

MSF: More drinking water needs to be made available

Mount Nyiragongo, 10km (six miles) from Goma, spewed lava 10 days ago, killing 32 people, the UN says.

There have been many tremors since one of the world's most active volcanoes erupted.

WHO horrified over sexual exploitation by aid workers in DR Congo

28 September 2021 Share Save Share Save

Getty Images Dozens of women accused WHO and other aid agency staff of sexual abuse and exploitation

World Health Organization (WHO) staff were among 83 aid workers who sexually abused women and girls while tackling the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a report finds.

The abuses, which included nine allegations of rape, were committed by both national and international workers between 2018 and 2020.

The report comes after more than 50 local women reported sexual abuse.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was "inexcusable".

The 35-page report was produced by an independent commission following an investigation.

The commission, which interviewed dozens of women who had alleged they were offered work in exchange for sex, found that 21 of the 83 alleged perpetrators were employed by the WHO.

Local women were also allegedly plied with drinks, "ambushed" in hospitals, forced to have sex, and two became pregnant.

The WHO said it was terminating the contracts of four people who were still employed by the organisation and promised more measures would be taken.

Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Dr Tedros said the report made for harrowing reading and apologised directly to the victims and survivors.

"I'm sorry for what was done to you by people who are employed by WHO to serve and protect you," he said. "It is my top priority that the perpetrators are not excused, but held to account."

He said the responsibility ultimately rested with him and promised to help support and protect victims, while vowing to overhaul the WHO's structure and culture.

WHO Africa regional director Matshidiso Moeti also apologised to those who suffered "because of the actions of our staff".

She said she was "humbled, horrified and heartbroken" by the inquiry's findings.

The commission said it found "clear structural failures and unpreparedness to manage the risks of incidents of sexual exploitation and abuse" in the central African country.

It said this was partly because of the focus on eradicating Ebola.

More than 2,000 people died in the Ebola outbreak in DR Congo.

Covid: DR Congo in race against time to vaccinate people

10 May 2021 Share Save Philippa Roxby Health reporter Share Save

Olivia Acland / UNICEF Jeanne Dusungu prepares to vaccinate people against Covid-19 in the Democratic Republic of Congo

Nurse Jeanne Dusungu is vaccinating anyone who turns up to the white Unicef tent in the grounds of North Kivu provincial hospital in Goma against Covid-19 - but very few are locals.

"There are some false rumours circulating, that the vaccine is fake, that it will make us sterile. There are people who think that," she says, disbelievingly.

"I tell the people to come and get vaccinated - it is protecting yourself and protecting others, your family, the entire nation."

But in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the second largest country in Africa and nearly the size of Western Europe, this is proving an uphill struggle.

Only 5,000 people have been vaccinated out of a population of nearly 90 million.

And in the city of Goma, where the rollout has just started after numerous delays, there is a worrying lack of interest.

Olivia Acland / UNICEF AstraZeneca vaccines have been delivered to 42 countries in Africa through Covax

It means 1.3 million AstraZeneca doses, out of 1.7 million received in early March through Covax - the international fair access scheme - are being redistributed to other African countries for use before they expire at the end of June.

The reasons are complex:

concerns over the potential link to rare blood clots in Europe delayed vaccine rollout in many African countries too, just as vaccination was starting

some European countries restricted use of the vaccine to certain age groups or gave away their doses altogether

as a result, harmful misinformation spread on social media about its safety

Olivia Acland / UNICEF The charity Unicef is helping to organise the vaccine rollout in Goma, eastern DR Congo

Olivia Acland / UNICEF It was mostly health workers and foreign aid workers who came to be vaccinated

There's also a lack of trust in the systems and governments and a feeling Covid is less of a threat than many other deadly diseases like Ebola and measles.

A recent outbreak of measles in DR Congo killed more than 7,000 people - many of them children, while Ebola outbreaks regularly occur.

For some Goma residents, Covid is not visible. Claudine, 40, a cleaner, says she has never seen anyone who died from it and is not scared of it, unlike Ebola.

Unicef

For others in the conflict-hit DR Congo, there are more pressing priorities than Covid-19.

"The war kills a lot more people than corona does," says Gabriel, 46, a taxi driver.

Josue, 23, a student, is put off by what he hears online and prefers to focus his energy on studying and then finding a job.

"We heard that Covid-19 would kill lots of people but much bigger problems are insecurity and unemployment, because we don't know even if tomorrow we'll be alive," says John Remi Bahati, who is 35 and unemployed.

How many vaccines is Covax delivering?

In Africa, 42 out of 54 countries have joined Covax and received 18.3 million doses between them, with nearly eight million used so far.

The international scheme aims to ensure equal access to safe and effective Covid vaccines worldwide,

The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine makes up more than 90% of doses supplied to Africa, which are manufactured in India.

Covax wants to vaccinate at least 20% of the African population by the end of 2021, with the first 3% - 90 million doses - going to health workers and other vulnerable groups.

What about other African countries?

African countries which are not part of Covax can access vaccines through the African Union or through their own deals with manufacturers.

Countries doing this include South Africa, Zimbabwe and Gabon.

In Malawi, where uptake of the vaccine had been very good, there's a different challenge.

False rumours started spreading that its vaccine stock was out of date after it received supplies of AZ from South Africa, which no longer wanted them.

Dr Charles Mwansambo, Malawi's health minister, told the BBC: "Unfortunately people thought all our vaccines had expired.

"Some stopped coming to our facilities completely, saying that they would be getting expired vaccines, whilst those that came ended up hesitating. So that reduced our numbers by about 50%," he said.

To restore public confidence, health officials in Malawi now plan to set fire to 16,000 unused doses.

Meanwhile, neighbouring Rwanda delivered all the AZ doses they received into arms within weeks, as did Ghana and Ethiopia, although there are concerns that delays to new supplies arriving from India could delay progress there.

High demand for vaccines in India means no deliveries to African countries until at least June.

Olivia Acland / UNICEF The DRC is one of many African countries which have unused Covid vaccines

The World Health Organization says 22 countries in Africa have used less than a quarter of their supplied vaccines. It says not using them quickly risks another wave of Covid.

It's now a race against time in these countries to increase people's trust in all the vaccines.

Dr Ayoade Alakija, head of the African Union's vaccine taskforce, says real damage has been done by headlines and delays over safety.

"In the US, there were announcements saying 'don't take the Johnson & Johnson vaccine but we will give you a Pfizer or a Moderna'. But in most parts of the world there isn't an alternative," she said.

Only just over 1% of the population of Africa have been vaccinated with a first dose, compared with 20% in Europe and 25% in the US.

One worry is that there could be uncontrolled spread of the virus among unvaccinated people which could lead to mutations, or a more virulent form of the disease emerging.

"Variants are my biggest worry if people stay unvaccinated," says Catherine Kyobutungi, executive director of the African Population and Health Research Centre.

To date, there have been about 122,000 deaths from Covid-19 across Africa - lower than the UK's death toll alone, but under-reporting means the true figure could be higher.

Vaccines are the only way to save lives from Covid-19 in the long term and building trust in them is now vital.

Nicolas Sinumyayo Barole, 60, who works in the health sector in Goma, had the vaccine and says: "Lots of people have not understood the importance of the vaccine.

"I want to tell them about the advantages, tell them to come and vaccinate themselves.

Six rangers killed in DR Congo's Virunga National Park

Six park rangers have been killed after an attack at the famous Virunga National Park in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Officials have blamed the attack on a militia group known as Mai-Mai, one of many that operate in the region.

The rangers were ambushed while on foot patrol inside the park, a spokesperson told the BBC.

Staff working in the park, which is home to endangered mountain gorillas, have often come under attack.

In April last year 13 rangers were killed in a rebel ambush.

Several armed groups operate in the restive eastern region of DR Congo where Virunga National Park - a Unesco World Heritage site - is based.

A statement from the park said preliminary investigations suggested the rangers "were taken by surprise and had no opportunity to defend themselves" during the Sunday morning attack.

It said another ranger who was seriously injured in the attack was receiving treatment and expected to make a full recovery,

A local government delegate Alphonse Kambale told AFP news agency that two Mai-Mai militants had also been killed.

DR Congo: Why tourists go to Virunga National Park

14 May 2018 Share Save Share Save

Getty Images Mountain gorillas are one of Virunga's main attractions

One of Africa's most stunning parks - Virunga in the Democratic Republic of Congo - has suffered a major blow following the killing of a ranger, and the abduction of two British tourists, who were later released. The attack has forced the park's boss - Belgian prince Emmanuel de Merode - to announce a suspension of tourism. This will be another setback to efforts to earn much-needed income to protect the World Heritage Site from the lawlessness that has gripped the region since the fall of long-serving ruler Mobutu Sese Seko more than two decades ago.

How dangerous is Virunga?

Boasting Africa's most diverse wildlife, Virunga - which stretches across 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) - is one of the most dangerous parks on the continent. The extent of the threat is reflected by the fact that between 1,500 and 2,000 armed fighters - according to Mr De Merode - roam Virunga and its surrounding areas. They belong to numerous different rebel groups, who battle for control of the region's rich resources. They fish illegally, slaughter its animals, fell its trees - and kill, rape and abduct locals and foreigners alike.

AFP Emmanuel de Merode is the first foreigner to head the park, which is also famous for its volcanoes

"The trafficking of natural resources last year was estimated to be worth more than $170m (£125m), of which these militia groups are draining about $47m. This is the scale of what the rangers are up against," Mr De Merode told the BBC's Newsday programme. The lawlessness in the park is linked to DR Congo sliding into chaos as the Mobutu regime lost his grip on power, before he was finally toppled in 1997. "Virunga suffered terribly. Poaching depleted the park's large mammal populations, infrastructure was destroyed, and many rangers were killed. The Congolese Wildlife Authority slowly lost control of Virunga and Unesco changed the World Heritage Site status to "endangered," the park says on its website. "Over the 25 years that followed, the park staff endured an almost uninterrupted series of trials that included a refugee crisis from the 1994 Rwandan genocide, which contributed to the severe destruction of park forests, and the proliferation of armed militias throughout the park... By the end of 2008 it seemed as if Virunga was finished," it adds.

Closed at the peak of conflict in the region, the park re-opened to tourists only in 2014 before shutting down again on Friday. "We will keep tourism suspended until we can assure the security of visitors. That will be a long process, and it will hit the park hard, very hard, financially, but there is no way around it," Mr De Merode told the BBC. Tourism contributes about $2m towards Virunga's annual budget of about $9m. "Most of our funding comes from the Buffet Foundation and European Union," Mr De Merode was quoted as saying on a National Geographic blog last year.

So why do tourists visit Virunga?

Founded in 1925 by Belgium's King Albert I, a visit to Virunga is a once-in-a-lifetime experience, with its forests, savannas, lava plains, swamps, erosion valleys, active volcanoes, and the glaciated peaks of the Rwenzori mountains, its website says. And as one tourist wrote: "I had climbed eight volcanoes before my trip to DR Congo, but Nyamuragira and Nyiragongo were heads above."

The park also has a wide variety of wildlife, including about a quarter of the world's remaining 880 mountain gorillas and 2,500 hippopotamuses which live on the banks of Lake Edward and the park's three rivers. Virunga has been heavily marketed in the West, and has the backing of the British royal family. "Anything to do with Congo is edgy; it's part of its allure," wrote Jessamy Calkin in the UK-based Telegraph newspaper last year. "That isn't to say it's without royal approval - Virunga enjoys a healthy relationship with the Royal Foundation, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry's charitable trust, and Virunga's director, Emmanuel de Merode was a keynote speaker at the Duke of Cambridge's United for Wildlife launch, in 2014," she added. The price tag for a visit is high: $400 a day for a mountain gorilla trekking permit, while staying at a lodge costs at least $300 a day. However, this is far cheaper than Rwanda, just across the border from the gorilla section of Virunga, where prices were raised to between $750 and $1,500 last year.

Although the UK Foreign office advised against travel to Virunga even before the latest kidnapping, the lower prices were an attraction for the more intrepid traveller. And few leave the park disappointed. "Climbing the volcano was amazing - it was a long trek but it was worth it for the incredible views at the top," one visitor wrote on a travel site, adding: "However, for me the highlight was definitely gorilla trekking. The journey to get there was challenging as there was a lot of scrambling through the jungle, but it was a lot of a fun. As we were in a group of six, the experience was really intimate and we were able to get really close to the gorillas."

How safe is it to work there?

Virunga National Park Rachel Masika Baraka was the eighth ranger killed this year

Aged 25, Rachel Masika Baraka was the first female ranger to be killed at Virunga, as she tried to save British tourists Bethan Davies and Robert Jesty from being kidnapped last week, apparently for ransom. Officials have declined to say how the two were released or whether their abductors have been detained. "She was one of the park's 26 female rangers and was highly committed, showing true bravery in her work," Mr De Merode said. Mr De Merode himself survived an ambush near the park in 2014. He was shot four times in the stomach and legs. He had apparently handed a prosecutor sensitive information about oil exploration at Virunga before he was shot. Ms Baraka was the eighth Virunga ranger killed this year. In April, five rangers and their driver were shot dead in an ambush by suspected militiamen.

DR Congo pardons two men over President Kabila assassination

DR Congo is facing parliamentary uncertainty after the president ended his coalition with Joseph Kabila

Two men convicted over the assassination of the Democratic Republic of Congo's President Laurent Kabila 20 years ago have been pardoned.

Although Mr Kabila was shot by his bodyguard, two of his senior officials, Col Eddy Kapend and Georges Leta, were implicated in the killing.

President Félix Tshisekedi commuted their death sentences last June.

The pardon comes amid a rift between Mr Tshisekedi and his predecessor, Laurent Kabila's son Joseph.

Joseph Kabila took power after his father's death in 2001 and ruled DR Congo for 18 years before Mr Tshisekedi won the election in December 2018.

Although it was the first peaceful transfer of power in the country in nearly 60 years, many disputed the election result. There were strong suspicions that the new president had done a backroom deal with Joseph Kabila, who still retains considerable clout in the country.

Oxfam suspends two aid workers amid sex exploitation claims in DR Congo

2 April 2021 Share Save Share Save

Getty Images Oxfam has been giving humanitarian assistance in DR Congo since 1971

UK charity Oxfam says it has suspended two members of staff in the Democratic Republic of Congo over allegations of sexual exploitation and bullying.

The charity said the suspensions were part of an "external investigation" set up last November into the allegations.

Its statement follows a report in the Times newspaper that whistleblowers were "frustrated at the length of time taken to complete the investigation".

Oxfam was hit by a scandal in 2018 involving its aid workers in Haiti.

The charity was accused of covering up the use of prostitutes by some members of staff who were in the country following the devastating 2010 earthquake.

Oxfam denied a cover up but apologised for mistakes in its handling of the scandal, set up an independent commission into working practices and stopped bidding for UK government funding.

The charity had only recently been allowed to start applying for government funding again, the Times reports.

The newspaper says a 10-page letter signed by more than 20 current and former Oxfam staff was sent to the organisation's leadership in February.

It made allegations against 11 people that included sexual exploitation, bullying, fraud and nepotism, and said whistleblowers had faced "threats to their lives".

Some of the complaints dated back to 2015, and the letter said staff had "lost faith in Oxfam's promises of accountability and in the principles Oxfam says it stands for".

In its statement, Oxfam says the Charity Commission was notified at the start of the investigation of the latest allegations and is being kept informed about its progress.

"We are acutely aware of our duty to survivors, including in supporting them to speak out safely," the charity said. "We are working hard to conclude the investigation fairly, safely and effectively".

Italian ambassador to DR Congo killed in UN convoy attack

22 February 2021 Share Save Share Save

Reuters Luca Attanasio was travelling in a UN convoy in the east of the country

Italy's ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Congo has been killed in an attack in the east of the country, its foreign ministry has said.

Luca Attanasio, 43, died in hospital on Monday after the United Nations convoy he was travelling in came under fire near Goma, a statement said.

The convoy reportedly belonged to the UN's World Food Programme (WFP).

An Italian military police officer travelling with the envoy and a Congolese driver were also killed.

"It is with deep sadness that the foreign ministry confirms the death, today in Goma, of the Italian ambassador," the ministry's statement said.

The attack in North Kivu province is believed to have been an attempted kidnapping, according to officials at the nearby Virunga National Park.

What do we know about the attack?

Mr Attanasio was a passenger in one of two vehicles travelling about 15km (nine miles) north of Goma when the attack happened on Monday morning.

The vehicles were "ambushed by a group of six attackers, who fired warning shots before taking all the passengers into the Virunga National Park", the governor of North Kivu province, Carly Nzanzu, told the BBC.

Reuters Security forces guard the area where the attack took place on Monday morning

"That's when a patrol of Virunga National Park rangers intervened and managed to free four people," he said.

"Unfortunately, before they ran away, the assailants shot the ambassador and his bodyguard, and they killed the Congolese driver at the start of the attack," the governor added.

The WFP said Mr Attanasio was travelling from Goma to visit a "schools programme" in the village of Rutshuru in eastern DR Congo.

"The attack... occurred on a road that had previously been cleared for travel without security escorts," the Rome-based agency said in a statement.

The two other fatalities were military police officer Vittorio Iacovacci, 30, who had been serving at the embassy since last September, and their Congolese driver, who has been named as Moustapha Milambo in media reports.

A number of other passengers were reportedly injured.

It is not clear who was behind the attack, but the interior ministry has accused a Hutu rebel group known as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).

Many armed groups are known to operate in and around the park and militias clash regularly in the east of the country, where a large UN force is struggling to keep the peace.

The DRC army has deployed troops to help search the area.

Questions over apparent security lapse

Analysis by Emery Makumeno, BBC News, Kinshasa

Mr Attanasio is the first ambassador to be killed in the country since French ambassador Philippe Bernard was shot dead during riots in the capital, Kinshasa, in 1997.

Normally, aid convoys travelling in eastern DR Congo are heavily guarded by UN troops, and questions are bound to be asked about the level of security that Mr Attanasio's convoy had.

He was travelling in the east - the most unstable part of DR Congo. Many local armed groups - as well as those from Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Uganda - have established themselves in the region over the last 25 years.

The attack highlights the fact that stability to the region will return only if a solution is found to political issues in all these countries.

What has the reaction been?

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi issued a statement offering his "deepest condolences", while President Sergio Mattarella condemned the "cowardly attack".

Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed his "great shock and immense sorrow" at the "brutal" killings.

"Today Italy mourns the loss of two of its sons and embraces their families," he said, adding: "No effort will be spared to shed light on what happened."

DR Congo's Foreign Minister, Marie Tumba Nzeza, said an investigation into the killings was under way.

Mr Attanasio had represented Italy in the DR Congo since 2017. He joined the diplomatic service in 2003 and spent time in Morocco and Nigeria.

What is the situation in DR Congo?

DR Congo was for many years at the centre of a brutal civil war that drew in several neighbouring countries.

The conflict led to the loss of some five million lives between 1994 and 2003, with some observers branding it Africa's Great War.

But the end of the conflict did not mark an end to the violence. Dozens of militias and rebel groups continue to operate in eastern areas.

The UN's peacekeeping mission has been in DR Congo since 1999. It is one of the biggest peacekeeping operations in the world, with more than 17,000 personnel on the ground.

Virunga - which stretches across 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) - is one of the most dangerous parks on the continent.

In 2018, a ranger was killed and three people - including two British tourists - were kidnapped when their vehicle was ambushed in the Virunga National Park. Those kidnapped were later released.

Mystery outbreak in DR Congo likely caused by malaria

Medical teams have been dispatched to take samples of the disease

Malaria has been identified as the likeliest cause of an illness that has killed more than 80 people in south-western Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa's main health agency said.

Victims of the previously unknown disease had been suffering flu-like symptoms such as fever, headaches, breathing difficulties and anaemia.

The majority of samples that have been tested indicated that they had caught malaria - which is caused by a parasite carried by mosquitoes and is endemic in the region - with widespread malnutrition exacerbating the situation.

However health experts are not ruling out the possibility of other factors at play in the Panzi health zone.

US and British citizens among 37 sentenced to death in DR Congo coup trial

(L-R) Benjamin Zalman-Polun, Marcel Malanga and Tyler Thompson are the three US citizens sentenced to death for the coup attempt

In total 51 people were tried in a military court, with hearings broadcast on national TV and radio.

Christian Malanga, a US national of Congolese origin, the suspected leader of the plot, was killed during the attack, along with five others.

The men were accused of leading an attack on both the presidential palace and the home of an ally of President Félix Tshisekedi in May.

Thirty-seven people - including three Americans, a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian national - have been sentenced to death over an attempt to overthrow the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Malanga's son Marcel, one of the US citizens sentenced to death, previously told the court that his father had threatened to kill him unless he took part.

His friend Tyler Thompson, was also given the death penalty. The pair, aged in their 20s, had played football together in Utah.

His stepmother Miranda Thompson in June told the BBC the family had "zero idea" how he had ended up in DR Congo.

"We were in complete shock as to what was happening, and the unknown. Everything we were learning was what we were getting off Google," she said.

The third American, Benjamin Zalman-Polun, had business interests with Christian Malanga.

Also sentenced to death was Jean-Jacques Wondo, a dual Congolese and Belgian citizen.

Human Rights Watch previously described him as a prominent researcher on regional politics and security, and suggested the evidence connecting him to the coup attempt was thin.

The AFP news agency reports that the Briton and Canadian nationals were of Congolese origin.

The court heard the British national, Youssouf Ezangi, had helped recruit some of the others who took part.

Of the 51 tried, 14 people were acquitted and freed, with the court finding they had no connection to the attack.

Those convicted have five days to appeal against their sentences.

Death sentences have not been carried out in DR Congo for roughly two decades - convicts who receive the penalty serve life imprisonment instead.

The government lifted this moratorium in March this year, citing the need to remove "traitors" from the nation’s dysfunctional army. However, no death penalties have been carried out since.

The attempted coup began in the capital, Kinshasa, in the early hours of 19 May. Armed men first attacked parliamentary speaker Vital Kamerhe’s home in Kinshasa then headed to the president’s official residence.

Witnesses say a group of about 20 assailants in army uniform attacked the palace and an exchange of gunfire followed.

An army spokesman later announced on national TV that security forces had stopped "an attempted coup d'etat".

Local media reports said the assailants were members of the New Zaire Movement linked to Malanga, an exiled DR Congolese politician.

Malanga was shot dead in the attack after resisting arrest, said army spokesperson Brig Gen Sylavin Ekenge.

President Tshisekedi was re-elected for a second term in disputed elections last year in December. He won about 78% of the vote.

DR Congo is a country with vast mineral wealth and a huge population. Despite this, life is difficult for many people, with conflict, corruption and poor governance persisting.

Much of the country's natural resources lie in the east where violence still rages despite Mr Tshisekedi's attempts to deal with the situation by imposing a state of siege, ceasefire deals and bringing in troops from neighbouring countries.

The children bearing the brunt of the mpox outbreak

26 August 2024 Share Save Simi Jolaoso in Lagos & Glody Murhabazi in eastern DR Congo BBC News Share Save

Glody Murhabazi All of Nzigire Kanigo's children have contracted mpox, including two-year-old Ansima

Children in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo are worst-affected by the current outbreak of mpox, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization. The country accounts for nearly all of this year’s recorded cases and more than 450 deaths. “It began like a small, inflamed spot. The mother squeezed it and watery discharge came out. Then another developed, and after a short period, they were all over the body,” says Alain Matabaro, describing how mpox developed in his six-year-old son Amani. He started recovering after four days of treatment at a clinic in Munigi, close to the major eastern Congolese city of Goma. Some 75% of the cases being seen by medics there are under the age of 10, according to Dr Pierre-Olivier Ngadjole who works for the charity Medair. Young people seem to be particularly badly affected by the mpox outbreak because of their less developed immune systems. Dr Ngadjole also blames overcrowding at a nearby camp set up for people forced from their homes by conflict in the region. One way mpox is spread is through very close contact and children “are always playing together. They don’t really care about social distance,” he tells the BBC. “You can also see in the households, they even spend the night in the same bed. You can find three, four, five children. The transmission is present on a daily basis.”

Glody Murhabazi The clinic in Munigi is now receiving up to 10 new patients a day

Since June, the clinic in Munigi, which provides free treatment including antibiotics to treat skin infections, paracetamol and safe drinking water, has dealt with 310 mpox cases. It is now seeing between five and 10 new admissions each day. No-one has died from the disease there and Dr Ngadjole believes it is because people are seeking help early. “I think it’s very important to provide free health services especially in this context… [It] means people don’t face any financial barrier, they come early to the health facility.” 'Mpox made my throat so painful I couldn’t sleep'

How worried should we be about mpox?

What is mpox and how is it spread? It is a different story 80km (50 miles) south-west of Munigi, on the other side of Lake Kivu, at a hospital in Kavumu. Eight-hundred patients have been seen there since June and eight have died – all under the age of five.

Glody Murhabazi Medics at the hospital in Kavumu are worried about a lack of space

Two-year-old Ansima Kanigo caught mpox from one of her four siblings, who have all had the disease. Her mother, Nzigire Kanigo, 35, had no idea what it was at first. "This is the first time I've seen it. When my child got sick, the other parents told me it might be measles, but we started treating measles and failed, so we decided to come here. “God bless the doctor who has brought the drugs… Three [children] are cured - they are at home. I only have two who I am admitted with now in this hospital. I thank God.” The medical director at the hospital, Dr Robert Musole, says the outbreak should not be underestimated by the authorities. “The situation is really serious, and we're so overwhelmed, because we have a small capacity, but we're in great demand. “The first challenge we face in this response is the accommodation of patients. The second challenge is the availability of medicines, which we don't have.” Across eastern DR Congo, there are several camps for the millions who have fled their homes as various rebel groups operate in the area. People are often crammed into makeshift structures and living in poor conditions without good sanitation - the perfect place for mpox to run rampant.

Health workers have been visiting places like Mudja camp near Mount Nyiragongo, to educate people on what to do when they spot symptoms, such as limiting contact with others. “This disease has brought us a lot of fear that we shall all get sick,” says Josephine Sirangunza, who lives in the camp with her five children. She says the government needs to give out some basic equipment to help stop the disease spreading. “When we see someone getting sick, we worry about how to protect ourselves.” It is a sentiment shared by Bosco Sebuke, 52, who has 10 children. “We have been sensitised [about mpox], but we are full of fear because we are crowded in our shelters. We sleep in very poor conditions, we share bedding, so prevention is difficult and because of that, we are afraid,” he says. The outbreak in eastern DR Congo is of a new strain of mpox called Clade 1b and it has now spread to neighbouring countries. Last week, the Congolese government said it hoped that vaccines would start to arrive from the US and Japan soon. Until then, the country does not have any vaccines despite being at the epicentre of the virus. Mr Matabaro, the father of Amani who is now recovering from mpox, says he is hopeful with news that vaccines could be on their way. But the distribution will be extremely limited and, as Dr Ngadjole says, vaccination is just one aspect of reducing the spread of the virus. “The [easiest] action to put in place is to improve the hygiene. When we improve the hygiene at household level, when we improve the hygiene at community level, it’s very easy to decrease the risk of transmission.” Ms Sirangunza echoes the doctor’s thoughts: “Tell our leaders to send us medicine, soap, and other protective measures so that we don’t get infected."

WHO declares mpox global health emergency

Hundreds of people have been killed by the current mpox outbreak

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond "is very worrying".

It has now spread across parts of central and east Africa, and scientists are concerned about how fast a new variant of the disease is spreading and its high fatality rate.

The highly contagious disease - formerly known as monkeypox - has killed at least 450 people during an initial outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak in parts of Africa a public health emergency of international concern.

Outbreaks can be controlled by preventing infections with vaccines, though these are usually only available for people at risk or those who have been in close contact with an infected person.

It causes flu-like symptoms, skin lesions and can be fatal, with four in 100 cases leading to death.

Mpox is transmitted through close contact, such as sex, skin-to-skin contact and talking or breathing close to another person.

"A co-ordinated international response is essential to stop this outbreak and save lives," he said.

There are two main types of mpox - Clade 1 and Clade 2.

A previous mpox public health emergency, declared in 2022, was caused by the relatively mild Clade 2. However, this time it is the far more deadly Clade 1 - which has killed up to 10% of those getting sick in previous outbreaks - that is surging.

There was a change in the virus around September last year. Mutations led to an offshoot - called Clade 1b - that has since spread rapidly. This new variant has been labelled “the most dangerous yet” by one scientist.

Since the start of the year, there have been more than 13,700 cases of mpox in the DR Congo, with at least 450 deaths.

It has since been detected in other African countries - including Burundi, the Central African Republic, Kenya and Rwanda.

It is hoped the declaration of mpox as a public health emergency will lead to research, funding, and the introduction of other international public health measures being accelerated.

Dr Josie Golding, from the Wellcome Trust, said it was a "strong signal", while Emory University's Dr Boghuma Titanji said the move "underscores the gravity of the crisis".

Prof Trudie Lang, the director of the Global Health Network at the University of Oxford, said it was "important and timely", but added that the emergence of a new strain meant there were "many unknowns that need to be addressed".

In July 2022 the milder Clade 2 strain of mpox spread to nearly 100 countries, including some in Europe and Asia.

It spread rapidly, and there were more than 87,000 cases and 140 deaths reported during that outbreak, according to a WHO count.

Although anyone can catch mpox, the outbreak was largely concentrated among men who had sex with men.

That outbreak was brought under control by vaccinating vulnerable groups.

On Tuesday, scientists from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention declared a public health emergency.

The head of the organisation, Jean Kaseya, warned that this current outbreak could spiral out of control if immediate steps were not taken to contain it.

"We must be proactive and aggressive in our efforts to contain and eliminate this threat," he said.

Tanzanian soldiers killed in DR Congo missile attack

A mortar attack in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has killed three soldiers from a southern African military force.

All of those who died were from Tanzania. Three others were hurt.

"Hostile" missile fire "fell near the camp where they were staying," said the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) on Monday.

A source has told the BBC that the attack took place at a base for Tanzanian soldiers in Sake on Saturday.

Sadc has not confirmed these details or said who was responsible for the attack on its soldiers.

The southern African regional force was invited in by the Congolese government last year to halt worsening insecurity linked to numerous rebel groups vying for control of territory and eastern DR Congo's rich mineral resources.

Chief among them is the M23 rebel group, which Rwanda has been widely accused of backing, including by UN experts, although Kigali has always vehemently denied this. In turn, it accuses the Congolese army of working with the FDLR, a militia linked to some of those responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, a charge rejected by Kinshasa.

After a lull in activity, the notorious M23 rebel group once again saw a resurgence in 2021 and now controls large parts of North Kivu province.

In recent months, thousands of people have fled the escalating violence in parts of eastern DR Congo. Many have taken shelter in the region's main city of Goma, which some fear the M23 could capture, as it did in 2012.

Pressure has grown on the DR Congo government after it ordered the large UN peacekeeping mission to leave the country by the end of 2024.

A total of 2,900 Sadc soldiers were sent to North Kivu province in December to take on the M23 rebels.

In its statement on Monday, Sadc said a soldier from South Africa had also died in hospital while being treated for health problems.

In February, two South African soldiers were killed by a mortar barrage in North Kivu province.

DR Congo floods: Digging through mud to find relatives

The villages of Bushushu and Nyamukubi were engulfed by flood water

They are having to pile up the bodies wrapped up in blankets in the villages of Bushushu and Nyamukubi in South Kivu province.

The Congolese Red Cross volunteers do not have body bags.

In several villages close to the shore of Lake Kivu, people have been digging through the mud with their hands in a desperate search for missing relatives.

The authorities had previously said 200 people had died following torrential rainfall on Thursday.

More than 400 people have died following floods and landslides that hit two villages in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo last week.

Communities have been trying to find bodies among the mud and debris

It is now four days since the floods hit and the number of dead keeps rising, now standing at at least 394. On Monday a national day of mourning is being held and flags are flying at half-mast. President Félix Tshisekedi is also due to visit the affected areas.

One distraught mother in Nyamukubi said her husband had survived and was in hospital but all her children were gone.

"It's like the end of the world," 27-year-old Gentille Ndagijimana, who also lost her parents and two sisters, told the AFP news agency.

Homes made of wooden planks with corrugated iron roofs were swept away.

Some areas have been almost entirely wiped out, according to a spokesperson for the medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).

"In two of the most affected areas where MSF is staying now, between half and three-quarters of the towns have been completely washed away," Igor Garcia Barbero told the BBC's Newsday programme.

The villages were "facing a humanitarian crisis", he said.

"The eastern part of Congo is already an area that is facing multiple crises," Mr Barbero added, because of thousands of people who have fled conflict in North Kivu, which means aid is already limited.

A civil society representative concurred with Mr Barbero's bleak assessment: "It is the worst flood we have ever had," Christian Zihindula Bazibuhe told the Reuters news agency.

The UN has warned that 3,000 families are now homeless because of the tragedy, Reuters reports.

The Red Cross in South Kivu has identified safety concerns for those who have survived the floods and are without homes, including the potential dangers of assault and rape for those living with host families and at accommodation sites.

Last week also saw floods across the other side of Lake Kivu in neighbouring Rwanda where more than 130 people were killed.

UN chief António Guterres said the floods were another illustration of accelerating climate change.

US blames Rwanda and rebels for deadly camp strike

More than 2.5 million people have been displaced in DR Congo, the US says, with many living in camps like Shabindu in Goma

Rwanda, which borders DR Congo, is widely accused of backing the rebel group and called the US accusation "ridiculous".

The Congolese army and M23 blamed each other for the attack.

At least nine people, including seven children, were killed in the strike on the Mugunga camp in the eastern city of Goma on Friday.

The US has blamed the Rwandan army and M23 rebel group for the deadly bombing of a displacement camp in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makalo said the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) was a professional army that would never attack a camp for Internally Displaced People (IDP).

The US State Department said Friday's attack came from positions held by the RDF and the M23 group.

A spokesperson said the US was "gravely concerned about the recent RDF and M23 expansion" in eastern DR Congo and called on both parties to "respect human rights and adhere to applicable obligations under international humanitarian law".

"It is essential that all states respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and hold accountable all actors for human rights abuses in the conflict in eastern DR Congo," they added.

Images circulating on social media showed bodies lying on the ground at the camp on Friday.

Most residents had fled there to escape fighting in their home towns and villages.

Lt Col Guillaume Njike Kaiko, a spokesman for DR Congo's army in the region, said the strike had come in retaliation for earlier Congolese attacks on Rwandan army positions.

President Félix Tshisekedi, who has spent several weeks abroad, will be returning to the central African country this weekend following the attack.

Rebel and government troops have both been accused in recent months of abuses against civilians as they vie for territorial control.

The latest strike comes days after M23 fighters claimed they had seized the town of Rubaya - an area which is at the heart of mining coltan used for making mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles.

Meanwhile, a military court in Goma has sentenced eight DR Congo soldiers to death for "desertion" and "cowardice" when fighting rebel forces.

M23, formed as an offshoot of another rebel group, began operating in 2012 ostensibly to protect the ethnic Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo, which had long complained of persecution and discrimination.

UN experts have said that the group is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, which is also led by Tutsis, something that Kigali has consistently denied.

South African troops killed in DR Congo: What is behind the Sadc deployment?

15 February 2024 Share Save Ian Wafula BBC News, Africa security correspondent Share Save

AFP South Africa plans to contribute 2,900 troops in total to a new regional force in DR Congo

South African troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo have suffered their first fatalities since their recent deployment to quell a rebellion.

Two soldiers were killed and three were injured after a mortar bomb landed in their base on Wednesday.

The attack has led to South African opposition politicians calling for the withdrawal of troops from DR Congo.

The troops are part of a regional force helping DR Congo's military as it confronts a series of armed groups.

The most prominent group is the M23, which has taken up positions on the major routes leading into Goma, the main city in the east of DR Congo.

Th M23's advance has resulted in tens of thousands being forced from their homes - adding to the nearly seven million who have fled because of multiple conflicts in the east.

But the South African army has not linked Wednesday's attack to the M23.

In a statement, it says the "details of this incident are still sketchy".

South Africa began deploying troops to eastern DR Congo in December under the banner of the 16-member regional bloc, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc).

They are taking over from the Kenyan-led East African Force (EAF), which left in December - about a year after it was welcomed by President Félix Tshisekedi.

He was re-elected in December for a second term in office - and one of his key campaign promises was to tackle the insecurity that has wracked the east of the country for three decades.

What reason has been given for the deployment?

Sadc has acted in the interests of solidarity, as DR Congo is part of the regional grouping.

It previously warned that an attack against one of its members would be met with "immediate collective action", and its troops would help DR Congo's military in "fighting" armed groups.

This view is more in tune with Mr Tshisekedi's - he wants a partner who will tackle the rebels head on.

Mr Tshisekedi booted out the EAF, accusing it of being ineffective and refusing to go on the offensive against the M23.

He has also ordered a UN force, which has been in the country for around 25 years, to leave by the end of 2024 after levelling similar accusations against it.

Can the Sadc force succeed?

South Africa is the regional superpower, and will form the backbone of the force.

Mr Tshisekedi is hoping that it will repeat the success it had during a previous deployment. That was more than a decade ago, when the M23 - accused of being backed by Rwanda - also made huge territorial gains in the resource-rich east.

Though then operating under the banner of a UN Intervention Brigade, Sadc troops forced the M23 to retreat. The M23 has since regrouped after a peace deal floundered, and is once again on the offensive.

Remadji Hoinathy, an analyst with the South Africa-headquartered Institute for Security Studies, said the M23 was now stronger and better equipped.

The AFP news agency has quoted a UN document as saying that the Rwandan army is using sophisticated weapons such as surface-to-air missiles to support the M23.

Rwanda has consistently denied backing the rebel group.

What is the strength of the Sadc force?

Dr Hoinathy said there was no clarity on its strength, but South Africa had a strong and well-equipped army.

Earlier this week, South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said that 2,900 troops were to be deployed, without saying how many were already in DR Congo.

Malawi and Tanzania are also sending soldiers, but have not yet given any details.

South Africa's two biggest opposition parties - the Democratic Alliance (DA) and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), are not happy about the deployment and not convinced about the effectiveness of the troops.

At a press conference on Thursday, EFF leader Julius Malema called for the immediate withdrawal of South African soldiers from DR Congo.

"They [South African troops] are sent there to be killed because they are not properly trained," he said.

"We just don't have the army. The ANC has collapsed the army," Mr Malema added, referring to the governing party, the African National Congress (ANC).

DA defence spokesman Kobus Marais said on X, formerly Twitter, that the fatalities were "avoidable", and the government had been warned that the deployment was "irresponsible and unacceptable".

In an earlier statement, he said the troops will be "sitting ducks" because of a lack of airpower.

"Without proper air cover as well as transport and air elements, the SANDF [South African National Defence Force] troops will find it difficult to operate effectively in eastern DR Congo, which is a complex and hostile terrain," Mr Marais added.

Mr Ramaphosa defended the deployment in parliament, saying South Africa was "part of peace-keeping missions all over the world".

"We salute our defence force personnel who brave great dangers to make Africa a more peaceful and stable continent. That is what we applaud them for and we dip our heads for those who are injured and for those who may have fallen," Mr Ramaphosa said.

Patrice Lumumba: DR Congo buries tooth of independence hero

30 June 2022 Share Save Damian Zane BBC News Share Save

AFP Patrice Lumumba's remains have been buried in a specially built mausoleum

The gold-crowned tooth of Democratic Republic of Congo independence hero Patrice Lumumba has been buried more than 60 years after he was assassinated.

It is the only part of his body that exists after his remains were dissolved in acid.

The Belgian policeman who oversaw the disposal took the tooth as a trophy.

It was returned to the family last week and has toured several parts of DR Congo in a coffin.

People have been able to pay their respects ahead of the funeral that took place in the capital, Kinshasa, on a road named in his honour.

President Félix Tshisekedi, Lumumba's family and other dignitaries were at the private service which took place before the coffin was transferred to a specially built mausoleum.

"May the land of our ancestors be sweet and mild to you," said the president.

Lumumba was the country's first prime minister and one of the leaders of the struggle for independence. He was also seen as one of the most prominent voices in Africa's anti-colonial movement.

Thursday marks 62 years since the former colonial power Belgium relinquished control of the vast country.

But it viewed Lumumba as a barrier to its efforts to maintain influence as well as hold on to important economic interests.

In a famous speech on independence day in 1960, in front of Belgian dignitaries including King Baudouin, Lumumba, aged 34, castigated Belgium saying that the Congolese had been held in "humiliating slavery".

The Belgians were stunned as a black African had never dared speak like this in front of Europeans.

Lumumba was toppled as prime minister just over two months later. Then in January 1961, with the tacit backing of Belgium, he was shot by a firing squad, along with two allies.

Jelle Vermeersch Belgian policeman Gerard Soete kept the tooth in a padded box in his home in Belgium

Other Western powers were also suspicious of him, fearing that he was sympathetic to the USSR during the Cold War and some, including the US, plotted to assassinate him.

A Belgian policeman, Gerard Soete, was given the job of getting rid of the evidence. It was during that process that he pocketed the tooth and took it back with him to Belgium.

It was decades later that he revealed that he still had the tooth and only two years ago that a Belgian court ruled that it should be returned to the family.

The Covid pandemic delayed the process but last week it was handed over in Brussels.

Key mining town seized - DR Congo rebels

DR Congo is rich in minerals, but most of its citizens are poor

It happened on the day France's President Emmanuel Macron called on neighbouring Rwanda to "halt its support" for the M23 rebel group.

The government has not yet commented, but a civil society activist confirmed that M23 had captured the strategic town.

Rubaya fell into the hands of M23 fighters on Tuesday following heavy clashes with government troops, Willy Ngoma said.

A town at the heart of mining coltan, a key ingredient in making mobile phones, has been seized in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo by rebel forces, their spokesman has said.

Mr Macron made his comments after holding talks with DR Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi in France's capital, Paris.

Rwanda has repeatedly denied backing the rebels, who have captured much territory in the mineral-rich east during fighting over the past 18 months.

DR Congo is the world's second-biggest producer of coltan, with most of it coming from the mines around Rubaya in the Masisi district.

Coltan is used to make batteries for electric vehicles and mobile phones.

DR Congo's government accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels to steal its mineral wealth, an allegation the government in Kigali denies.

Mr Ngoma told the BBC that M23 had seized Rubaya "not because of its richness, but to chase away our enemy".

A civil society activist in Masisi, Voltaire Sadiki, said the rebels had “ordered civilians with guns to hand them [in] and continue with their lives”.

The rebels, initially Congolese army deserters, accuse the government of marginalising the country's ethnic Tutsi minority and refusing to negotiate with them. They regard the verdant hills around Masisi as their true homeland.

Mr Tshisekedi says the rebels are a front for what he calls the "expansionist aims" of Rwanda, which it denies.

DR Congo conflict: M23 rebels executed over 130 civilians - UN

Vigils have been held in Kinshasa and Goma for those killed

A UN investigation has found that at least 131 civilians in the Democratic Republic of Congo died in a November attack by the M23 rebel group.

The UN report said the massacre took place in two villages - Kishishe and Bambo - in the Rutsuhuru district of the eastern North Kivu province.

Investigators said the attack appeared to be a reprisal for a current government offensive on the rebels.

M23 denied the massacre, blaming "stray bullets" for just eight deaths.

But the UN's Monusco peacekeeping mission in the country said 102 men, 17 women and 12 children were "arbitrarily executed" by the rebel group "as part of reprisals against the civilian population".

At least 22 women and five girls were also raped, the report said

"This violence was carried out as part of a campaign of murders, rapes, kidnappings and looting against two villages in the Rutshuru territory as reprisals for the clashes between the M23" and other armed groups, including the FDLR, the statement said, adding that the true number of killed could be even higher.

It also said that M23 fighters then buried the bodies of the victims in "what may be an attempt to destroy evidence".

The government had initially said that over 300 civilians were killed in the attack, which took place between 29-30 November. But its spokesman Patrick Muyaya accepted on Monday that it was difficult to arrive at a firm figure as the region was under M23 occupation.

Congolese authorities have described the killings as war crimes and called for deeper investigation, while protests have been organised in the capital, Kinshasa and Goma, the main city in North Kivu.

DR Congo protests: Anti-UN anger rages amid war crime warning

28 July 2022 Share Save Emmanuel Igunza and Patrick Jackson BBC News, Nairobi and London Share Save

Watch: Protesters clash with UN peacekeepers in DR Congo

Police in the eastern part of Democratic Republic of Congo have clashed with demonstrators on a third day of violent anti-UN protests. At least 19 people including three members of the UN peacekeeping force have been killed, officials say. Protests erupted in the town of Goma as people accused the UN of failing to contain violence by armed groups. The UN warns attacks on its mission, on the ground for more than two decades, may constitute a war crime.

Attacks were made on two of its bases, in Goma and in Butembo, where two Indian peacekeepers and a third member of the UN force were killed. More than 50 people have been injured since the clashes began on Monday. On Wednesday, protesters again targeted UN bases in the region. A spokesman said UN Secretary General António Guterres had called on the Congolese authorities to investigate the incidents. There was no initial evidence that its peacekeepers had shot at the protesters, another UN official said.

Reuters The UN has denied firing at any protesters

The UN blamed the violence and looting of its property on criminals pretending to be protesters. It said they had seized weapons from local police and opened fire. "Mobs are throwing stones and petrol bombs, breaking into bases, looting and vandalising, and setting facilities on fire," said Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for Mr Guterres, in a statement. "The situation is very volatile and reinforcements are being mobilised. Our quick reaction forces are on high alert and have been advised to exercise maximum restraint, using tear gas to disperse protestors and only firing warning shots when UN personnel or property are under attack." Congolese troops were helping protect UN facilities, Mr Haq added. Local police have also accused some members of armed groups of infiltrating the protests to incite hatred of the peacekeepers, whose force is officially known as Monusco. The DR Congo's army is battling both the M23 armed movement and the Allied Democratic Force (ADF), a group affiliated with so-called Islamic State, and many other militias. Anger is widespread over the UN's failure to halt violence by armed groups operating in the mineral-rich east. "They are tear-gassing us because we came to say that Monusco does not help us," protester Anselme Musimbwa told the Reuters news agency in Goma on Tuesday. "They've been in Congo for 22 years and nothing works." Fellow protester Jack Sinzahera said: "We have our own police that will look after our security and property. We don't want anything to do with Monusco." UN peacekeepers have often been targeted by rebels in DR Congo and have often faced accusations of failing to protect civilians - criticism the UN has always dismissed. But the latest protests pose a serious complication for the UN's largest and most heavily funded peacekeeping mission. More on this topic:

DR Congo floods leave more than 120 dead in Kinshasa

More than 120 people have been killed following the worst floods in years in the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kinshasa, the authorities say.

Major roads in the city centre were submerged as heavy rains continued for hours and several homes collapsed.

Many of those who died were in hillside areas which suffered landslides on Tuesday.

The government has announced a three-day period of national mourning.

Entire neighbourhoods were flooded with muddy water, and houses and roads ripped apart by sinkholes, including the N1 highway that connects the capital to the country's main port of Matadi.

Kenga Mwamba told BBC News Swahili that his house had collapsed, trapping his family inside.

"There was no way of getting inside my house. I was only able to rescue one child. I saw my wife's body floating in the house. I saw my other three kids under the rubble, they were already dead. Neighbours came to help remove the bodies after the rain stopped."

An AFP journalist saw the bodies of nine members of a single family who were killed when their home collapsed.

"We've never seen a flood here on this scale," said Blanchard Mvubu, who lives in one of the worst affected areas.

"I was asleep and I could feel water in the house. It's a disaster - we've lost all our possessions in the house, nothing could be saved."

Prime Minister Jean-Michel Sama Lukonde led a government delegation through parts of Kinshasa to assess the damage on Tuesday.

He said officials were still searching for more bodies.

Earlier on Tuesday, the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo joined the United States in blaming climate change for the major flooding.

"The DRC is under pressure but unfortunately it's not sufficiently heard or supported," President Félix Tshisekedi told Secretary of State Antony Blinken as they met at a US-Africa summit in Washington.

The flooding was an example of "what we have been deploring for some time," he said, adding that those countries which were responsible for pollution should do more to help those which are suffering.

His spokesperson said the president might cut short his trip to the US because of the disaster.

Kinshasa is located on the River Congo and has seen a huge population influx in recent years, with 15 million people now living there.

Many dwellings are shanty houses built on flood-prone slopes, and the city suffers from inadequate drainage and sewerage.

"One of the main reasons why this is happening is because of the poor housing, and poor planning," Longombo Dieudonné from the Red Cross rescue team told the BBC.

"When it rains, there is no path for water to flow because people have blocked drainage paths with their houses, and water will find any path to move."

BBC weather presenter Stav Danaos said: "Although the information from the area is limited because of lack of weather stations, we think in excess of 6in/150mm of rain fell around the capital on Monday night/early Tuesday.

"It's also hard to be certain of the forecast for the next few days but there is the potential for further showers and storms around, perhaps lasting in to the weekend, but not as intense as we [have] already seen."

In November 2019, about 40 people in Kinshasa died in floods and landslides.

DR Congo protests: Ten die in fresh anti-UN demonstrations

26 July 2022 Share Save Samba Cyuzuzo BBC Great Lakes Share Save

Reuters Protesters have been calling for the UN mission to leave the country

Ten people have died during protests against a UN peacekeeping force in Butembo in the Democratic Republic of Congo, police and UN officials say.

Seven victims in the eastern city were civilians, and three were UN personnel.

Local media said the protesters were shot by peacekeepers, who they blame for failing to restore peace amid a resurgence of attacks by armed groups.

The UN mission's acting head Khassim Diagne told the BBC: "The UN hasn't fired at any protesters."

He said Tuesday's attackers were "criminals" masquerading as protesters, who claimed they wanted to submit a memorandum - but then opened fire as they approached the UN base.

There has been a recent upsurge in violence in the area and the rebel militias posed new a threat for UN peacekeepers, he said.

"We are looking at very organised groups who are now overwhelming our bases, and shooting down our helicopters and all of that.

"It's very clear that the challenges we are facing now, are more complex than they were a few years ago despite efforts that have been made to clear certain areas."

The east of DR Congo remains volatile with more than 100 active rebel groups.

This was the second day of protests with people calling for the UN to withdraw its peacekeepers from the area.

On Monday, the demonstrations, called by the government's youth wing, turned violent when protesters stormed and looted the UN mission's local headquarters and a base in the city of Goma.

At least five people were killed, officials said. Then on Tuesday the protests intensified.

"They are teargassing us because we came to say that Monusco does not help us. They've been in Congo for 22 years and nothing works," protester Anselme Musimbwa said.

Another demonstrator, Jack Sinzahera said: "We have our own police that will look after our security and property, we don't want anything to do with Monusco."

One of the graphic images shared on social media showed someone lying still on the ground, while others shouted that he had been shot dead by the UN forces.

On Monday, Mr Diagne said it was "not in chaos and confusion or division that we will make progress towards stabilisation and peace.

"[Monusco] stands alongside the people and supports the national defence and security forces in their fight against the armed groups."

AFP On Monday, the gates of a UN compound in Goma were targeted

There have been protests against the UN over the years in Goma and other towns in the east of the country, but not on this scale or level of violence.

A UN peacekeeping force has been in DR Congo for more than two decades. Monusco took over from a previous UN mission in 2010.

But critics point out that in that time rebel activity has not ended and people in the region continue to live in a state of insecurity.

Monusco currently has almost 18,000 personnel in the country, including more than 12,000 soldiers - Pakistan, India and Bangladesh have provided the largest number of troops. It is preparing to draw down - though no date has been set.

There has been an uptick in the conflict there involving several armed groups including the M23 movement and the Allied Democratic Forces.

DR Congo accuses neighbouring Rwanda of supporting the M23, which Rwanda denies. Three weeks ago, the countries' two leaders agreed on a "de-escalation process" in eastern DR Congo.

Lumumba and his party also toured Mount Vernon, George Washington’s riverside plantation. A guide emphasized the first American president’s legacy as an anticolonial fighter.

“What was the attitude of the English towards him?” Lumumba asked when they reached Washington’s bedroom.

“Oh, they treated him with respect.”

“Modern-day colonists are not so gallant,” Lumumba replied with a smile.

Part of Lumumba’s goal in visiting the United States was to recruit skilled Americans who could fill the posts left vacant by Belgian workers — people who could serve as engineers, lawyers, doctors, dentists and nurses in the Congo. On the campus of Howard University, the United States’ premier historically Black college, he met with a small group of professors and students. Most of Howard’s 6,000 students were American, but 83 hailed from Africa, and Lumumba jumped at the chance to chat with some of them in their native tongues. None came from the Congo, but he pledged that would change soon and urged Howard’s American students to cross the ocean to “work on the land of their ancestors.”

At the Mayflower Hotel, just north of Blair House, he met with a Methodist missionary couple who had known him from primary school and encouraged them to send more teachers and medical workers to the Congo. In the ballroom below, diplomats, journalists and various friends of Africa mingled at a reception held in his honor. Lumumba and his aides took the opportunity to redouble their recruitment efforts.

Yvonne Reed, just 22 years old and fresh out of college, attended the reception in the stead of her mother, who was active in the civil rights movement. Like her mother, Reed had often felt the sting of racism — Washington was still largely segregated at the time — and although she felt out of place at the reception, she was eager to meet the Congolese prime minister. By the time she arrived, the receiving line had broken and Lumumba was enmeshed in a circle of reporters. But she buttonholed one of his aides, who told her that the Congo was looking for American talent. Might she come work there?

The next morning, Reed dressed herself in a suit and took a taxi to Blair House. A man from the Soviet embassy pushed past her to ring the bell but was told Lumumba was busy. Reed, however, was ushered into a waiting room. Lumumba walked down the staircase.

“So you’re interested in going to the Congo?” he asked.

She was. No discussion ensued about what, exactly, this young, inexperienced woman would do, but Lumumba instructed his aides to see to it that her paperwork was taken care of. He would be leaving for the Congo from New York in a matter of days. “That’s it,” he said, with a decisiveness that impressed Reed. “I’ll see you on the plane.”

It was a sign of just how bad the Belgian brain drain from the Congo was that Lumumba was willing to accept all comers, no matter how short their résumés. And as it turned out, Reed did not get on the plane in New York, because her parents thought better of the idea. She ended up going to the Congo much later — and, it must be said, is the mother of the comedian Dave Chappelle. Reed would always look back fondly on her fleeting encounter with Lumumba. “He was a strong leader,” she said. “He knew what he was doing.”

At Blair House, some of Lumumba’s American interlocutors, already primed to view Black leaders as rubes, nitpicked about his lack of familiarity with Western manners. Between courses of lunch, a State Department officer suppressed a smirk when the prime minister, upon being delivered a finger bowl — for washing one’s hands — drank out of it. State Department escorts found fault, too, in Lumumba’s improvisational approach to scheduling. They were constantly trying to hustle along the Congolese delegation, usually in vain. Lumumba stood up an Indiana politician who had flown in from out of town to talk about foreign aid. “You just don’t do that to a U.S. Senator when you are asking for money,” an aide vented to Time.

One incident would become legendary in diplomatic circles. According to the young State Department officer assigned to Lumumba in D.C., the prime minister discreetly requested a “blonde” for the evening. The officer, Thomas Cassilly, called a contact in the CIA, who promptly arranged a hotel room and a suitable woman. Lumumba had railed against philandering in his earlier writing — “the wife is not like a shirt which one can change at will: marriage is ‘a life contract’” — but expressed satisfaction with the choice that night.

Coming on the heels of stories about Black men raping white women in the Congo during the mutiny, Lumumba’s assignation, which became known to the White House yet was never exploited, played especially poorly within the Washington establishment (never mind that it gave a free pass to serial adulterers such as Allen Dulles). Officials were already giving Lumumba mixed reviews. One anonymous official characterized him to a reporter this way: “Erratic, but a tough, clever guy.” But there was one chance for Lumumba to speak directly to the highest levels of the American government and make his own impression. The centerpiece of Lumumba’s trip to the nation’s capital was a meeting at the State Department. Washington had heretofore known him only telescopically, judging him from a distance through cables and news clippings. Now it could examine him up close.

The meeting began at 3:00 p.m. in the secretary of State’s grand fifth-floor office, the afternoon light piercing venetian blinds. Herter presided, joined by three other State Department officials and an interpreter. Lumumba, who brought three Congolese officials with him, began with praise. “The people of the Congo, even in their most remote villages, have faith in the United States,” he said. “We know that the United States is anticolonial.” He went on to correct Brussels’ version of events since June 30, explaining how Belgium had emptied the treasury, intervened illegally across the country and engineered the secession of Katanga. He knew the United States and Belgium were allies, but couldn’t Washington talk some sense into its transatlantic partner? In fact, he said, the United States might serve as a good mediator, a role in which the U.N. seemed to be failing. Lumumba also reiterated his request for U.S. aid. His government was unable to make payroll. Could the United States lend it money? What about equipment? He had twice been thwarted from flying where he needed to go in the Congo. “Would it be possible for us, through official channels, to obtain a plane, which could be used by the head of state and me for the trips we have to make into the interior of the country?”

Herter was sixty-five years old, a grandfather several times over. He had begun his diplomatic career during World War I and spoke in the soothing, mid-Atlantic accent one would expect of a Massachusetts Republican and husband of a Pratt heiress. He had broad shoulders and bushy eyebrows and, the day he met Lumumba, sported a polka-dot bow tie. He was the very picture of American diplomacy.

Thus he had little problem deflecting Lumumba’s many requests. Pressuring Belgium to withdraw its troops? That was a matter for the U.N. now. Direct bilateral economic aid? All funds had to be channeled through the U.N. A plane? Also a question for the U.N.

“I wonder if it would not be proper for me to present my respects to the president,” Lumumba said.

“Unfortunately I do not know his schedule,” Herter replied.

When Lumumba asked whether he might be able to merely meet one of the presidential candidates, Vice President Richard Nixon or Senator John F. Kennedy, Herter again demurred.

Officials had steeled themselves for an erratic child, but over the hour-and-a-half meeting, according to contemporaneous accounts, Lumumba convinced them that he was fundamentally reasonable. Time reported that “Washington officials, who had expected a ranting fanatic, found instead a poised, almost impassive, man.” The Christian Science Monitor announced that Lumumba had “made a favorable impression” — “favorable by contrast to the advance stories out of the Congo that had pictured the youthful Congolese Premier as wielder of threats and ultimatums, as the Congo’s Castro, as an anti-West, pro-Soviet revolutionary-turned-statesman.”

A career Foreign Service officer in attendance echoed this assessment, finding “no evidence” that Lumumba was crazy, as critics had suggested. Other officials registered his “brilliance” and “articulateness.” Even Lumumba’s solicitation of a plane was viewed somewhat sympathetically, with Herter passing on the request to the U.N.

Years later, however, one official present would offer a very different account of the meeting. Douglas Dillon, the number two at the State Department, would tell Church Committee investigators in 1975 that he found Lumumba “psychotic” and “impossible to deal with”:

“When he was in the State Department meeting, either with me or with the Secretary in my presence, he spoke in a manner that seemed almost messianic in quality. And he would never look you in the eye. He looked up at the sky. And a tremendous flow of words came out. He spoke in French, and he spoke it very fluently. And his words didn’t ever have any relation to the particular things that we wanted to discuss. And it was just like ships passing in the night. You had a feeling that he was a person that was gripped by this fervor that I can only characterize as messianic. And he was just not a rational being.”

Whether Dillon’s assessment reflected the private consensus of July 1960 or was an ex post facto exaggeration, colored by knowledge of what Lumumba became, one cannot know for sure. Regardless, despite a few positive reports from the meeting, a consensus that he was unfriendly toward the United States was hardening in Washington. In August, the National Review deemed Lumumba “a cheap embezzler, a schizoid agitator (half witch-doctor, half Marxist), an opportunist ready to sell out to the highest bidder, ex-officio Big Chief Number One of a gang of jungle primitives strutting about in the masks of Cabinet Ministers.” Washington was starting to consider whether to replace Lumumba with someone more suited to U.S. interests. “We wondered whether there was any way of changing the scenery in the Congo,” Dillon would say.

The subject came up at an interagency conference Dillon attended at the Pentagon shortly after meeting Lumumba. Someone raised the prospect of assassinating Lumumba, but a CIA representative shut down the discussion, perhaps because the group was too large for such a sensitive topic, or perhaps because the idea was deemed impractical. Nonetheless, a new idea had been floated, a moral boundary probed.

By August 1960, President Eisenhower was 69 years old, nearing the end of his second term, and running out of steam. He had survived Cold War crises in Cuba, Korea, Hungary and the Suez, not to mention a heart attack, a stroke and intestinal surgery. After the shootdown of a U-2 spy plane over Russia in May scotched an East-West peace summit in Paris, the president largely lost interest in the duties of his job and played golf almost daily. “I wish someone would take me out and shoot me in the head so I wouldn’t have to go through this stuff,” he huffed one day in July, after a National Security Council meeting brought him bad news from Cuba and the Congo.

Patrice Lumumba: the most important assassination of the 20th century

Patrice Lumumba: the most important assassination of the 20th century

The US-sponsored plot to kill Patrice Lumumba, the hero of Congolese independence, took place 50 years ago today

Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja

Originally published by The Guardian, Monday 17 January 2011

Patrice Lumumba, the first legally elected prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), was assassinated 50 years ago today, on 17 January, 1961. This heinous crime was a culmination of two inter-related assassination plots by American and Belgian governments, which used Congolese accomplices and a Belgian execution squad to carry out the deed.

Ludo De Witte, the Belgian author of the best book on this crime, qualifies it as “the most important assassination of the 20th century”. The assassination’s historical importance lies in a multitude of factors, the most pertinent being the global context in which it took place, its impact on Congolese politics since then and Lumumba’s overall legacy as a nationalist leader.

For 126 years, the US and Belgium have played key roles in shaping Congo’s destiny. In April 1884, seven months before the Berlin Congress, the US became the first country in the world to recognise the claims of King Leopold II of the Belgians to the territories of the Congo Basin.

When the atrocities related to brutal economic exploitation in Leopold’s Congo Free State resulted in millions of fatalities, the US joined other world powers to force Belgium to take over the country as a regular colony. And it was during the colonial period that the US acquired a strategic stake in the enormous natural wealth of the Congo, following its use of the uranium from Congolese mines to manufacture the first atomic weapons, the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.

With the outbreak of the cold war, it was inevitable that the US and its western allies would not be prepared to let Africans have effective control over strategic raw materials, lest these fall in the hands of their enemies in the Soviet camp. It is in this regard that Patrice Lumumba’s determination to achieve genuine independence and to have full control over Congo’s resources in order to utilise them to improve the living conditions of our people was perceived as a threat to western interests. To fight him, the US and Belgium used all the tools and resources at their disposal, including the United Nations secretariat, under Dag Hammarskjöld and Ralph Bunche, to buy the support of Lumumba’s Congolese rivals , and hired killers.

In Congo, Lumumba’s assassination is rightly viewed as the country’s original sin. Coming less than seven months after independence (on 30 June, 1960), it was a stumbling block to the ideals of national unity, economic independence and pan-African solidarity that Lumumba had championed, as well as a shattering blow to the hopes of millions of Congolese for freedom and material prosperity.

The assassination took place at a time when the country had fallen under four separate governments: the central government in Kinshasa (then Léopoldville); a rival central government by Lumumba’s followers in Kisangani (then Stanleyville); and the secessionist regimes in the mineral-rich provinces of Katanga and South Kasai. Since Lumumba’s physical elimination had removed what the west saw as the major threat to their interests in the Congo, internationally-led efforts were undertaken to restore the authority of the moderate and pro-western regime in Kinshasa over the entire country. These resulted in ending the Lumumbist regime in Kisangani in August 1961, the secession of South Kasai in September 1962, and the Katanga secession in January 1963.

No sooner did this unification process end than a radical social movement for a “second independence” arose to challenge the neocolonial state and its pro-western leadership. This mass movement of peasants, workers, the urban unemployed, students and lower civil servants found an eager leadership among Lumumba’s lieutenants, most of whom had regrouped to establish a National Liberation Council (CNL) in October 1963 in Brazzaville, across the Congo river from Kinshasa. The strengths and weaknesses of this movement may serve as a way of gauging the overall legacy of Patrice Lumumba for Congo and Africa as a whole.

The most positive aspect of this legacy was manifest in the selfless devotion of Pierre Mulele to radical change for purposes of meeting the deepest aspirations of the Congolese people for democracy and social progress. On the other hand, the CNL leadership, which included Christophe Gbenye and Laurent-Désiré Kabila, was more interested in power and its attendant privileges than in the people’s welfare. This is Lumumbism in words rather than in deeds. As president three decades later, Laurent Kabila did little to move from words to deeds.

More importantly, the greatest legacy that Lumumba left for Congo is the ideal of national unity. Recently, a Congolese radio station asked me whether the independence of South Sudan should be a matter of concern with respect to national unity in the Congo. I responded that since Patrice Lumumba has died for Congo’s unity, our people will remain utterly steadfast in their defence of our national unity.

Why Ugandan troops have entered DR Congo - again

4 December 2021 Share Save Patience Atuhaire BBC News, Kampala Share Save

Ugandan army The Uganda army has released a series of photos of its soldiers in DR Congo

Ugandan forces have once again crossed the country's western border to go into the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Previous incursions have been extremely controversial with troops in the past fighting soldiers from Rwanda, carrying out atrocities and plundering the country's natural resources.

But this time it is with the approval of DR Congo's government.

Why are Ugandan troops in DR Congo?

Speaking a few days after a suicide attack last month in the heart of the capital, Kampala, President Yoweri Museveni called on those responsible to surrender: "My advice to all of them… if they do not come out, they will die."

The government was clearly determined to pursue the militants wherever they may be.

In the last and most audacious of a series of attacks on 16 November, three bombers blew themselves up and killed at least four others in the process.

The government blamed a militant Islamist rebel group called the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which was founded in Uganda but was then forced into DR Congo. It says it is now part of the Islamic state group.

AFP The suicide attack in central Kampala shocked Uganda

On Tuesday, the Ugandan army confirmed that it had carried out airstrikes on ADF targets across the border. Then on Wednesday hundreds of Ugandan troops were seen crossing into DR Congo.

The Congolese government said it had invited its neighbour's armed forces into the country as the ADF is one of many armed groups wreaking havoc in eastern DR Congo.

The ADF, flushed out of Uganda in the early 2000s, has been attacking and looting Congolese villages, killing people and forcefully recruiting children for at least the last decade.

How serious is the fighting?

A resident of the city of Beni, near the border, told the BBC that he could hear the sound of explosions.

"There is serious fighting. The Ugandan soldiers entered on foot and with vehicles. We have seen drones flying."

Video clips have circulated on social media showing villagers close to Beni watching columns of Ugandan soldiers march past.

But officials from both the Ugandan and Congolese governments have not given many details away, save to confirm the presence of Ugandan troops.

The Uganda army has released a series of photos which show columns of soldiers in DR Congo accompanied by armoured vehicles and tanks.

It says thousands of ADF fighters were killed in the airstrikes but has not provided any evidence and it has not been possible to verify.

The operation will be reviewed every two months, it said in a statement.

The spokesperson for the Congolese army, Gen Leon Kasonga, said the fighting was happening in remote areas, including in the middle of a forest and the Virunga National Park, which stretches along the two countries' border.

He added that troop movements, the duration of the operation and casualty figures were confidential.

What has been the reaction in Uganda?

Opposition politicians and some commentators have strongly opposed the troops' incursion into DR Congo.

This is partly because the deployment was carried out without consulting or getting approval from parliament, as the constitution requires.

But Uganda has ignored this before. There was no consultation when troops went into DR Congo in the 1990s. And in 2013, Ugandan forces crossed over into South Sudan to support President Salva Kiir without parliament's approval.

What about in DR Congo?

While many Congolese are desperate to see an end to ADF attacks, some do not have good memories of previous Ugandan incursions.

The reaction of Congolese Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr Denis Mukwege sums up some of the concerns.

AFP The ADF has been blamed for numerous attacks in eastern DR Congo

"No to arsonists/firefighters, the same errors will produce the same tragic effects. Stand up Congolese, Nation in danger!" he tweeted earlier this week.

Activist group Lucha has also expressed concern, saying that this was not the way to bring peace to the troubled region.

Addressing the Congolese army, it said in a statement that "confidence… has to be earned. The people need to have a government and an army in which they can really place all their confidence."

A spokesperson for Monusco, the UN force in DR Congo, said inviting the Ugandans was a legitimate choice and the UN encouraged "regional countries to work together to solve the cross-border threat".

Monusco has previously conducted joint operations with the Congolese army to try and stop the ADF attacks but they still continue.

What happened the last time?

The Ugandan army has a soiled reputation for its incursions in DR Congo in the 1990s and early 2000s.

In 1999 and 2000, Ugandan and Rwandan armed forces, each backing a different faction of the RCD rebel group, clashed in the Congolese city of Kisangani.

Ugandan army Uganda has sent tanks and armoured vehicles into DR Congo

The RCD was fighting to overthrow the president at the time, Laurent Kabila.

In what has come to be known as the Six-Day War, over 1,000 people are said to have been killed in June 2000, as Ugandan and Rwandan forces fought to take control of the city.

Ugandan troops were accused of human rights abuses against the population during this phase of fighting.

Among the claims were that they sexually exploited local women.

The Ugandan forces were also accused of plundering the DR Congo's vast natural resources.

A 2001 UN report said forces from Uganda, as well as other neighbours, looted minerals, coffee, timber and livestock.

In 2005, the International Court of Justice said Uganda had to pay reparations to DR Congo for the illegal invasion. The money has still not been handed over.

Why is eastern DR Congo a haven for rebel groups?

The resource-rich region has attracted rebels for decades. Some reports suggest there could be at least 120 different militant groups based there.

The fighting has become as much about control of the country's riches as political power. Some neighbouring countries have been accused of backing rebels in order to benefit from the chaos through plunder.

Despite President Felix Tshisekedi declaring what was termed a "state of siege" - essentially martial law - in the two affected provinces, attacks and killings of residents have continued.

DR Congo joins East Africa trade bloc: Who gains?

29 March 2022 Share Save Peter Mwangangi BBC Africa Business Reporter, Nairobi Share Save

AFP DR Congo has some of the highest levels of poverty in the world, according to the World Bank

The Democratic Republic of Congo has joined the East African Community (EAC) as its seventh member, massively expanding the territory of the trade bloc, giving it access to the Atlantic Ocean and greatly increasing the numbers of French speakers in what began as a club of former British colonies.

What changes immediately?

EAC heads of state have approved the admission of DR Congo into the bloc at a summit meeting, but although it officially has become a member, not much can change straight away.

Congolese lawmakers still have to ratify the EAC laws and regulations before they come into effect.

Congolese citizens wishing to visit the other member countries - Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda - without a visa may need to wait a little longer because full integration into the EAC could take months or even a year.

For example, South Sudan took four months from acceding to the community treaty in April 2016 to becoming a full member of the EAC in August that year.

Why does DR Congo want to join the EAC?

DR Congo applied for membership in 2019, hoping to improve trade and political ties with its East African neighbours.

It will allow Congolese citizens to travel freely to the other countries and trade will become much quicker, simpler and cheaper, which should benefit businesses and consumers in all countries.

The country shares borders with all EAC members except Kenya, and hopes to attract more investors from the region.

Joining the bloc gives DR Congo better access to facilities such as the Indian Ocean ports of Dar es Salaam and Mombasa.

Import taxes for goods accepted as being made in DR Congo will be removed or greatly reduced when entering the other countries, while transporting goods will become much cheaper.

"We have been waiting for this announcement for a long time. We are very happy," Ley Molo Ley, a Congolese trader based near the Ugandan border, told the BBC.

It is currently not straightforward for Congolese business people to travel to Uganda, he said: "For a Congolese to get travel documents to visit Uganda, they need to pay $45 (£35) at the DR Congo side of the border. Then when they reach the Ugandan side, they need to pay $50 for a visa. Then there are charges for a Covid-19 test, so in total you pay about $120."

What about the other members?

Roman Waema, head of the Kenya Long Distance Truck Drivers and Allied Workers Union, is looking forward to the end of the interminable waiting he currently has to endure to get into DR Congo.

"Currently we face a lot of issues, such as queuing to get a visa for entry into DRC, waiting for days to get our goods cleared at the border thereby incurring huge parking, storage fees, among other costs before getting to our final destination," he said.

The process of transporting goods across borders should become much simpler - currently authorities at the border points all operate different systems.

"There will be faster clearance of goods. Once the one-stop border post opens, customs officials from both Uganda and DRC will sit in the same building to clear goods and people," says Guma Morris, who oversees the Uganda Revenue Authority office at the Mpondwe border.

The inclusion of DR Congo's consumer market of close to 90 million people will expand the EAC market to almost 300 million, and open the bloc to the Congolese economy which is rich in all kinds of natural resources.

Dr Abel Kinyondo, an economist at the University of Dar es Salaam, believes that DR Congo's inclusion will boost the bloc's bargaining power globally.

"Numbers matter in international trade - the addition of DRC's economy to the community implies increased purchasing power," he said.

EAC Secretary General Peter Mathuki is very excited. "We are neighbours with the DRC, but we don't trade much with it simply because there is no framework. Most of the goods coming into DRC are from outside East Africa like Zambia and Asia," he told the BBC.

"Therefore, we are looking forward to putting in place a mechanism that's going to ensure trade between ourselves and DRC improves."

In theory, the East African countries could gain access to West Africa and the Atlantic Ocean through DR Congo, but the country's road and rail networks would need to be massively upgraded first. The only way of getting across this vast country, which is two-thirds the size of western Europe, at the moment is by air.

This potential expansion of trade links from the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic would help expand the region's economic potential at a time when the continent is working to implement the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA).

What are the challenges?

It won't be easy to integrate such a huge, chaotic country into the rest of the EAC.

The country's poor infrastructure and insecurity have been a matter of concern to EAC partner states.

"If you look at the border posts that enter or border DRC, once you get to these borders, literally the infrastructure stops," said Damali Ssali, a trade expert.

"Even the infrastructure that is supposed to catalyse trade at the border is not as good as when you compare to the other countries. Then once you get into DRC, the corridors leading into the major towns have to be worked on because the roads are very poor."

Then there is insecurity.

AFP DR Congo has faced decades of instability and recently witnessed a string of massacres

In December 2021, Ugandan troops crossed into DR Congo at the invitation of the Congolese government to help eliminate the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), one of many armed groups wreaking havoc in the resource-rich east of the country.

"Insecurity restricts trade - however, more official trade between the EAC and DRC may actually reduce conflict in the eastern part of DRC as it would reduce smuggling as a result of greater cooperation in various areas including customs, trade, and security," says Penina Simba, a trade consultant.

What language will the EAC use?

English and Swahili are currently the official languages of the East African Community, although there has been talk about introducing French, which is spoken in Rwanda and Burundi.

DR Congo's official languages are Swahili, French, Lingala, Kituba (Kikongo) and Tshiluba. Experts say that the multilingual nature of the region should be looked at as an opportunity and not a barrier.

There has been a push to promote the widespread use of Swahili, especially after the African Union adopted it as an official working language in February 2022. However, some regions such as western DR Congo and parts of the other EAC states do not speak it.

"Going forward, we expect an EAC that is multilingual, which could even lead to more interaction between EAC citizens and the Francophone countries in Central Africa," Ms Simba said.

DR Congo data leak: Millions transferred to Joseph Kabila allies

19 November 2021 Share Save Africa Eye BBC World Service Share Save

AFP Joseph Kabila was president of DR Congo from 2001-2019

Companies owned by family and friends of former Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila had millions of dollars of public funds funnelled through their bank accounts, according to Africa's biggest data leak.

The money was transferred to the companies' accounts at the Congolese arm of the BGFI bank.

Millions of dollars in cash were then taken out of the accounts.

Mr Kabila was president at the time of the bank transfers.

In a statement published online, he called the reports "unfounded accusations".

The leak included more than three million documents and information on millions of transactions from the BGFI (Banque Gabonaise et Française Internationale) bank, which works in several African countries and France. Online French investigative journal Mediapart and the NGO Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF) obtained the information.

BBC Africa Eye had access to the evidence, as part of a consortium called Congo Hold-up, co-ordinated by the media network European Investigative Collaborations (EIC).

The investigation raises questions about who benefitted from the money transfers and possible conflicts of interests.

High-value cash withdrawals

The managing director of BGFI's DR Congo subsidiary, BGFI Banque RDC, from 2012 to 2018 was Francis Selemani, Joseph Kabila's foster-brother.

Mr Kabila's sister, Gloria Mteyu, owned 40% of BGFI's DR Congo operation, which was set up in 2010.

One privately owned company, Sud Oil, was shown to have received nearly $86m in public funds from November 2013 to August 2017.

These include at least $46m from the DR Congo banking regulator, BCC, $15m from the state mining company Gécamines, and $1.3m from the country's electoral body, Ceni.

The only information the BBC found from the leak concerning these payments was an invoice for just over $1m from Ceni to Sud Oil for petroleum products.

The electoral commission, Ceni, paid Sud Oil $1m for petroleum products

The BBC found no evidence Sud Oil was trading in petroleum products at the time.

Mr Selemani's wife, Aneth Lutale, owned 80% of Sud Oil and Mrs Mteyu owned the remaining 20% from 2013 to 2018.

Millions of dollars were transferred out of Sud Oil's BGFI accounts to other private companies' BGFI accounts. Some of these were owned by relatives or business associates of Mr Kabila, who was president from 2001-2019.

One of these companies, Kwanza Capital, was majority owned by Congolese businessman Pascal Kinduelo, with Sud Oil taking a minority stake. Mr Kinduelo was chair of BGFI Bank RDC at the time.

Mr Kinduelo was also a former owner of Sud Oil, before transferring ownership.

The investigation found the bank allowed many high-value cash withdrawals from Sud Oil accounts, including one for $6 million. By law a maximum of $10,000 is allowed to be withdrawn in cash per day. This limit can only be breached for specific, documented purposes, such as national emergency or defence reasons.

BBC Africa Eye found no evidence in the leak that correct procedures were followed in these instances. These cash withdrawals from Sud Oil accounts totalled at least $50 million covering a four-year period. Once the money was withdrawn, it is believed to have become untraceable.

Audit found firm 'very high risk'

Our investigation was only able to establish that Sud Oil, for the period 2013 to 2018, had one employee, managing director David Ezekiel, and a small office in the capital Kinshasa as its address. In October 2013 Sud Oil purchased a real estate complex in the capital for $12m, basing the company there.

It also had a contract with BGFI Banque RDC to provide new vehicles to several of its senior management, including Mr Selemani. It charged $70,000 to provide his four-wheel drive car.

BBC Africa Eye found no evidence of any other business activities.

The investigation had access to an internal BGFI audit, completed in July 2018, heavily criticising the bank's DR Congo operation. The audit was never meant to be made public.

It gave a score of "very high risk" for the DR Congo subsidiary. It also referenced a lack of integrity and transparency in the declaration of conflicts of interest and compliance in its operations with clients.

The audit named Mr Selemani as having at least 16 declared conflicts of interest, including links to private companies holding accounts at the bank. It also highlighted several high-value transactions by Sud Oil.

Two weeks after the report was complete, Mr Selemani was moved to a new role at BGFI's head office in Gabon. He reportedly received $1.4m on leaving BGFI Banque RDC. He is reported to have left BGFI in November 2018.

Sud Oil changed ownership in 2018 and Kwanza Capital was closed down the same year. Mrs Mteyu is understood to have given up her 40% stake in BGFI Banque RDC.

BBC Africa Eye contacted BGFI, Joseph Kabila, Francis Selemani, Aneth Lutale, David Ezekiel and Gloria Mteyu over the information contained in the leak. None responded to our questions. We also contacted Pascal Kinduelo, who declined to respond.

Gecamines and BCC did not reply to the BBC's requests for a response.

The head of Ceni at the time of its dealings with Sud Oil, Corneille Nangaa, declined to comment on the payment, citing parliamentary confidentiality rules. Mr Nangaaa added that a new management team was now in place at the electoral body.

BBC Africa Eye's investigation will be available online to watch from 29 November.

DR Congo's Goma volcano: 'It's a miracle that so little lava came out'

Hundreds of homes have been destroyed in Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo after a nearby volcano, Mount Nyiragongo, erupted on the 22nd of May.

The UN's children's agency, Unicef, says that more than 100 children are missing after having been separated from their parents.

Volcanologist Dario Tedesco says that the situation could have been made even worse had more lava come out.

Mount Nyiragongo: DR Congo residents flee as volcano erupts

23 May 2021 Share Save Share Save

Lava destroys houses after DR Congo volcano erupts

Thousands of people fled their homes in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the night after a large volcano erupted.

As the sky turned red and rivers of lava streamed from Mount Nyiragongo, there were concerns that its past deadly tragedies would be repeated.

A mass evacuation was launched in the city of Goma, which has a population of about two million people.

However, the city was largely spared and some residents are now returning.

The volcano, located 10km (six miles) from Goma, last erupted in 2002, killing 250 people and making 120,000 homeless.

There has been no official report of casualties during the latest eruption and it is unclear how many homes have been damaged.

On Sunday morning, Communications Minister Patrick Muyay tweeted to say the intensity of the lava flow had slowed and an assessment of the humanitarian situation was ongoing.

The BBC's Emery Makumeno in DR Congo's capital Kinshasa said a greater quantity of the lava took the direction of the forest, flowing away from the city.

Our reporter said it stopped short of the international airport, despite earlier reports to the contrary. However, it did set some houses on fire and crossed a graveyard.

One resident, Zacharie Paluku, told the Associated Press news agency that the eruption had sparked fear and people began running. "We really don't know what to do," he said.

Some locals complained about the lack of information from the authorities amid conflicting accounts circulating on social media.

Crowds were seen with mattresses and other belongings, fleeing even before the government's announcement, which came several hours after the eruption started.

Many residents headed across the nearby Rwandan border, while others went to higher ground to the west of the city.

Rwandan authorities said about 3,000 people had officially crossed from Goma. The country's state media said they would be accommodated in schools and places of worship.

One Goma resident, Richard Bahati, said he was in his house when he heard screaming. "I got out and saw the sky was red. I am so worried, so worried. I lived through the problem with this volcano in 2002. The volcano devastated all our homes and possessions."

Electricity was out across large areas in the aftermath of the eruption.

"There is a smell of sulphur. In the distance you can see giant flames coming out of the mountain," resident Carine Mbala told AFP news agency.

Mount Nyiragongo is one of the world's more active volcanoes but there were concerns that its activity had not been properly observed by the Goma Volcano Observatory, since the World Bank cut funding amid allegations of corruption.

In a report on 10 May, the observatory warned that seismic activity at Nyiragongo had increased.

Last year, the observatory's director, Katcho Karume, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action that the volcano's lava lake had been filling up quickly, increasing the chances of an eruption in the next few years. But he also warned that an earthquake could trigger a disaster earlier.

Ten DR Congo prisoners sentenced for mass rapes in jail

19 January 2022 Share Save Share Save

Getty Images The riot broke out at a prison near Lubumbashi in September 2020 (file photo)

Ten prisoners have been found guilty of raping dozens of female inmates during a violent riot at an overcrowded jail in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Thirty-seven women and a teenage girl testified that they were repeatedly raped during a three-day riot at Kasapa Central Prison near Lubumbashi in 2020.

Some female detainees became pregnant and contracted sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

The 10 men were fined and ordered to serve 15 additional years in jail.

Although some of the inmates were too frightened to give evidence, dozens testified before a military prosecutor that they had been raped during the riot.

Melanie Mumba, a lawyer for the victims, told AFP news agency: "We are satisfied with the verdict, after a long struggle to gain justice".

The run-down prison facility was taken over by a group of male inmates for several days in September 2020.

They set the women's section of the prison on fire with female detainees - including a 16-year-old girl - forced to sleep in a prison yard where they were subjected to sexual assaults.

Some 20 inmates and a prison guard were reportedly killed during the violence before security forces regained control.

The mass rapes were highlighted in reports by Human Rights Watch (HRW), who urged authorities to investigate the assaults and offer adequate care to those impacted.

The campaign group said the prison, built to house 800 inmates, had almost 2,000 people in detention during the incident. It said poor hygiene, sanitation and healthcare were all reported at the facility, with repeated warnings a riot would break out reportedly ignored by senior officials.

Thomas Fessy, senior DR Congo researcher at HRW, told the BBC that the prosecution of 10 inmates "should only be seen as a first step".

"Of the 56 female detainees in the prison at the time of the riot, 37 women and a teenage girl testified to Lubumbashi's public prosecutor that male inmates had raped them and every perpetrator should be held accountable for these acts," he said in an emailed statement.

Mr Fessy also said the Congolese state had "failed to protect and provide safety" for inmates during the incident.

Noella Bashizi, a defence lawyer for the accused, told the AFP news agency she would consult her clients about whether to appeal against the sentences given on Wednesday.

HRW reported in 2021 that at least seven detainees, including a 16-year-old girl, became pregnant amid the unrest.

Coronavirus in DR Congo: How funds went missing - report

The study says one hospital charged $2.9m (£2.1m) for the care of just 266 coronavirus patients (library photo)

Missing money, opaque pay practices and poor management hamper the coronavirus response in the Democratic Republic of Congo, researchers say.

The Congo Research Group, based in New York University, says several new committees were set up that cost more money but failed to solve the problems.

Its report says only $6m of the $363m Covid funding awarded by the IMF last year has been publicly accounted for.

The Congolese government has not responded to BBC requests for comment.

DR Congo is one of 50 countries across the world that have failed to fully vaccinate 10% of their population against coronavirus - in a target set by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Estimates suggest that about 0.1% of the country's 89 million people have had a vaccine. To date, more than 57,000 people are known to have contracted coronavirus in DR Congo according to the WHO and 1,086 of them have died.

Challenges include its reliance on the oft-criticised Covax scheme, an underfunded health system already ravaged by concurrent outbreaks of measles, Ebola and cholera, the widespread mistrust of the authorities, and conflict between the government and armed groups in the country's east.

Added to this, critics say, is endemic corruption.

Two former health ministers have been arrested over corruption allegations in recent years - one is serving a five-year jail term, while the other is free on bail and denies the allegations.

The Congo Research Group says the lessons have not been learnt from previous failures in the management of health funds, and claims at least $240,000 went missing in the purchase of ambulances and vehicles for the health ministry's Covid response.

The study also quotes a government oversight body, the Inspection Générale des Finances, as saying one hospital in Kinshasa could not under any circumstance justify a recent invoice of $2.9m for the care of just 266 coronavirus patients.

Researchers also say the health ministry used emergency situations and international funding "to pay bonuses to staff who are not normally well paid". Their report says the health ministry declined to reveal how many staff it had or how much it had paid out in bonuses.

"Ad hoc structures" put in place by the Congolese government in response to the pandemic - including a "multisectoral committee", a "technical secretariat", advisory council, presidential taskforce and a national solidarity fund against the coronavirus - have increased budgets but failed to solve pre-existing problems, according to the Congo Research Group.

It lists these problems as:

Ebola: DR Congo launches Butembo vaccination campaign

15 February 2021 Share Save Share Save

@WHOAFRO DR Congo had kept vaccines for emergency use, officials say

An Ebola vaccination campaign has been launched in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo after an outbreak earlier this month, the WHO has said.

DR Congo has confirmed four cases of Ebola since a resurgence of the virus was announced on 7 February in Butembo.

Health workers at a medical centre, where the first Ebola patient was treated, were the first to be vaccinated, the WHO said.

The news comes a day after Guinea, in West Africa, declared an outbreak.

A previous Ebola outbreak in DR Congo was declared over in June 2020.

It had claimed the lives of 2,287 people since August 2018.

About 8,000 doses of the Ervebo vaccine, which were kept after the outbreak, are being used in the latest inoculation campaign, the BBC's Emery Makumeno reports from the capital Kinshasa.

Ervebo was the first Ebola vaccine to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2019.

Separately, Guinea on Sunday declared a new Ebola outbreak, following seven confirmed cases and three deaths.

They fell ill with diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding after attending the burial of a nurse near the south-eastern city of Nzérékoré.

Some simple techniques can help prevent spread of Ebola.

"The WHO is on full alert and is in contact with the manufacturer [of a vaccine] to ensure the necessary doses are made available as quickly as possible to help fight back," the AFP news agency quoted Alfred George Ki-Zerbo, the WHO representative in Guinea, as saying.

Between 2013 and 2016 more than 11,000 people died in the West Africa Ebola epidemic, which began in Guinea.

Liberia's President George Weah has put the health authorities on heightened alert to prevent the spread of the virus.

The BBC's Umaru Fofana in Sierra Leone says there is far more fear of Ebola in the country than Covid-19.

He says the existence of new vaccines does provide some sense of relief - there is a global emergency stockpile of 500,000, made available through Gavi, the international vaccine alliance.

The three countries have a joint population of 22.5 million, prompting concerns that manufacturers would have little time to produce more if needed at a time when Covid vaccines are their preoccupation, our reporter says.

What is Ebola?

Ebola is a virus that initially causes sudden fever, intense weakness, muscle pain and a sore throat

It progresses to vomiting, diarrhoea, and both internal and external bleeding

People are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola

DR Congo: Thousands flee Goma after second volcano warning

27 May 2021 Share Save Share Save

BBC Around a third of Goma's residents have been ordered to evacuate

Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from the city of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo over fears of another volcanic eruption.

Local authorities have said Mount Nyiragongo could erupt once again with little warning.

The volcano, 10km (six miles) from Goma, spewed lava over the weekend, killing 32 people and leaving thousands homeless, the UN says.

Thousands fled then but some residents had started returning.

The area has been rattled by more than 200 aftershocks which have destroyed several buildings, while two cracks several hundred metres in length have appeared in the ground.

Goma is a lakeside city where around 670,000 people live, according to UN estimates.

Tremors have also been felt more than 90km away in the Rwandan capital, Kigali.

Ndima Kongba, the military governor of North Kivu province, ordered the evacuation of nearly a third of the city's residents on Thursday, saying magma had been detected underneath Goma and nearby Lake Kivu.

"Right now we can't rule out an eruption on land or under the lake," Mr Kongba said, ordering 10 districts of the city to evacuate.

"It is very important to stay away from the lava flows, because of the danger of death from suffocation or burns," he said.

As well as the risks from lava and earthquakes, there are also concerns that seismic activity could destabilise a huge methane bubble trapped under Lake Kivu.

Reuters Large cracks have appeared in the ground caused by aftershocks from the weekend eruption

Authorities have arranged for people to be transported to the city of Sake, around 20km west of Goma.

Others are leaving the city by ferry, others by car, creating traffic jams, and others on foot, carrying their possessions.

Local resident Alfred Bulangalire, 42, left the city with his wife and four children. "I know that my shop will be looted, but I have to protect myself and my family," he told Reuters news agency.

Thousands entered Rwanda, staying in the border city of Gisenyi, reports the BBC's Samba Cyuzuzo.

Rwandan authorities are directing these people to a former refugee camp and a secondary school.

Many residents of Gisenyi itself have fled east, deeper into Rwanda, as earth tremors continue to shake the city. Rwandan authorities have reported earthquakes on Thursday reaching 4.9 magnitude.

Rivers of molten rock streamed from Mount Nyiragongo during its eruption on Saturday, setting houses and forest alight on the edges of Goma.

One stream of lava stopped close to Goma's airport, the main hub for humanitarian aid operations in the east of the country.

DR Congo's Goma volcano: Drone images show devastation

The UN's children's agency, Unicef, said it had rescued 530 missing children separated from their parents during the eruption.

Mount Nyiragongo is one of the world's more active volcanoes but there were concerns that its activity had not been properly observed by the Goma Volcano Observatory since the World Bank cut its funding amid allegations of corruption.

In a report on 10 May, the observatory warned that seismic activity had increased.

EPA Last week's eruption lit up the night sky around Goma and destroyed hundreds of homes

EPA Magma from last week's eruption has already scorched many local farms and villages.

Last year, the observatory's director, Katcho Karume, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action that the volcano's lava lake had been filling up quickly, increasing the chances of an eruption in the next few years. But he also warned that an earthquake could trigger a disaster earlier.

Leopold II: Belgium 'wakes up' to its bloody colonial past

12 June 2020 Share Save Georgina Rannard & Eve Webster BBC News Share Save

Getty Images Leopold II ruled Belgium from 1865-1909 - activists want this statue in Brussels removed due to his brutal regime in Congo Free State

Inside the palatial walls of Belgium's Africa Museum stand statues of Leopold II - each one a monument to the king whose rule killed as many as 10 million Africans.

Standing close by, one visitor said, "I didn't know anything about Leopold II until I heard about the statues defaced down town".

The museum is largely protected by heritage law but, in the streets outside, monuments to a monarch who seized a huge swathe of Central Africa in 1885 have no such security.

Last week a statue of Leopold II in the city of Antwerp was set on fire, before authorities took it down. Statues have been daubed with red paint in Ghent and Ostend and pulled down in Brussels.

Leopold II's rule in what is now Democratic Republic of Congo was so bloody it was eventually condemned by other European colonialists in 1908 - but it has taken far longer to come under scrutiny at home.

Getty Images Before a renovation in 2018, Belgium's Africa Museum was known as the world's "last colonial museum"

Last week thousands in the country of 11 million joined solidarity protests about the killing of US black man George Floyd in police custody.

A renewed global focus on racism is highlighting a violent colonial history that generated riches for Belgians but death and misery for Congolese.

"Everyone is waking up from a sleep, it's a reckoning with the past," explains Debora Kayembe, a Congolese human rights lawyer who has lived in Belgium.

Statues defaced and removed

Like statues of racist historical figures vandalised or removed in Britain and the US, Leopold II's days on Belgian streets could now be numbered.

On Monday the University of Mons removed a bust of the late king, following the circulation of a student-led petition saying it represented the "rape, mutilation and genocide of millions of Congolese".

Joëlle Sambi Nzeba, a Belgian-Congolese poet and spokesperson for the Belgian Network for Black Lives, says the statues tell her she is "less than a regular Belgian".

Getty Images Thousands marched in Black Lives Matter protests in Belgium

"When I walk in a city that in every corner glorifies racism and colonialism, it tells me that me and my history are not valid," she explains from the capital.

For activists the holy grail is the giant statue of Leopold II on horseback at the gates of the Royal Palace in Brussels. A petition calling on the city for its removal has reached 74,000 signatures.

"I will dance if it comes down. I never imagined this happening in my lifetime," Ms Kayembe adds. It would be "really significant for Congolese people, especially those whose families perished," she explains.

She does not believe it will not be quick or easy. There are at least 13 statues to Leopold II in Belgium, according to one crowd-sourced map, and numerous parks, squares and street names.

Warning: This piece contains graphic pictures

One visitor to the Africa Museum, where an outdoor statue was defaced last week, disagreed with the idea of removing them - "they're part of history," he explained.

A king who still commands praise

On Friday the younger brother of Belgium's King Philippe, Prince Laurent, defended his ancestor saying Leopold II was not responsible for atrocities in the colony "because he never went to Congo". The royal palace is yet to give its own response.

For many years Leopold II was widely known as a leader who defended Belgium's neutrality in the 1870-71 Franco-Prussian war and commissioned public works fit for a modern nation.

Reuters This TV image shows a statue of Leopold defaced and damaged by fire being removed in Antwerp

In 2010, former Belgian foreign minister Louis Michel and the father of future prime minister Charles Michel, called Leopold "a hero with ambitions for a small country like Belgium".

In a TV debate this week, a former president of the Free University of Brussels, Hervé Hasquin, argued there were "positive aspects" to colonisation, listing the health system, infrastructure, and primary education he said Belgium brought to Central Africa.

Colony built on forced labour and brutality

"Civilisation" was at the core of Leopold II's pitch to European leaders in 1885 when they sliced up and allocated territories in what became known as the Scramble for Africa.

He promised a humanitarian and philanthropic mission that would improve the lives of Africans.

Getty Images Colonial officials amputated and mutilated Congolese people, including children, as punishment

In return European leaders, gathered at the Berlin Conference, granted him 2m sq km (770,000 sq miles) to forge a personal colony where he was free to do as he liked. He called it Congo Free State.

It quickly became a brutal, exploitative regime that relied on forced labour to cultivate and trade rubber, ivory and minerals.

Archive pictures from Congo Free State document its violence and brutality.

In one, a man sits on a low platform looking at a dismembered small foot and small hand. They belonged to his five-year-old daughter, who was later killed when her village did not produce sufficient rubber. She was not unique - chopping off the limbs of enslaved Congolese was a routine form of retribution when Leopold II's quotas were not met.

Colonial administrators also kidnapped orphaned children from communities and transported them to "child colonies" to work or train as soldiers. Estimates suggest more than 50% died there.

Killings, famine and disease combined to cause the deaths of perhaps 10 million people, though historians dispute the true number.

Leopold II may never have set foot there, but he poured the profits into Belgium and into his pockets.

He built the Africa Museum in the grounds of his palace at Tervuren, with a "human zoo" in the grounds featuring 267 Congolese people as exhibits.

RMCA Tervuren; A. Gautier, 1897 Congolese people were forced to be human exhibits in a "zoo" in Belgium in 1897

But rumours of abuse began to circulate and missionaries and British journalist Edmund Dene Morel exposed the regime.

By 1908, Leopold II's rule was deemed so cruel that European leaders, themselves violently exploiting Africa, condemned it and the Belgian parliament forced him to relinquish control of his fiefdom.

Belgium took over the colony in 1908 and it was not until 1960 that the Republic of the Congo was established, after a fight for independence.

When Leopold II died in 1909, he was buried to the sound of Belgians booing.

Alamy Missionaries documented amputations while investigating abuses committed in Congo Free State

But in the chaos of the early 20th Century when World War One threatened to destroy Belgium, Leopold II's nephew King Albert I erected statues to remember the successes of years gone by.

This makeover of Leopold's image produced an amnesia that persisted for decades.

Calls for apologies

The current protests are not the first time Belgium's ugly history in Congo has been contested in the streets.

In 2019, the cities of Kortrijk and Dendermonde renamed their Leopold II streets, with Kortrijk council describing the king as a "mass murderer".

And in 2018, Brussels named a public square in honour of Patrice Lumumba, a hero of African independence movements and the first prime minister of Congo, since renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Last year a UN working group called on Belgium to apologise for atrocities committed during the colonial era.

Charles Michel, prime minister at the time, declined. He did however apologise for the kidnapping of thousands of mixed-race children, known as métis, from Burundi, DR Congo and Rwanda in the 1940s and 1950s. Around 20,000 children born to Belgian settlers and local women were forcibly taken to Belgium to be fostered.

What next for the statues?

Statues of Leopold II should now be housed in museums to teach Belgian history, suggests Mireille-Tsheusi Robert, director of anti-racism NGO Bamko Cran. After all, destroying the iconography of Adolf Hitler did not mean the history of Nazi Germany was forgotten, she points out.

AFP This bust of Leopold II was removed on Friday in Auderghem, near Brussels

In Kinshasa, the capital of DR Congo, Leopold II's statues were moved to the National Museum.

"Leopold II certainly does not deserve a statue in the public domain," agrees Bambi Ceuppens, scientific commissioner at the Africa Museum. But taking the monument away does not solve the problem of racism, she believes, while creating one museum devoted to the statues would not be useful either.

In DR Congo itself, no-one has really noticed the Belgian protests, says Jules Mulamba, a lawyer in the south-eastern city of Lubambashi. He attributes colonial crimes to the king himself, rather than the Belgian people or state.

Beyond removal of statues, far more work is required to dismantle racism, protesters and black communities argue.

For decades, colonial history has been barely taught in Belgium. Many classrooms still have Hergé's famous cartoon book Tintin in the Congo, with its depictions of black people now commonly accepted as extremely racist.

Belgium's education minister announced this week that secondary schools would teach colonial history from next year.

Rwanda-backed rebels seize key town in DR Congo

The M23 says it is protecting ethnic Tutsis from persecution

Angola has been attempting to mediate talks between President Félix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame. But these broke down last month.

The group has taken control of vast swathes of eastern DR Congo since 2021, forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes.

This is the second town seized by the M23 group in as many days in the mineral-rich North Kivu province.

Rebel forces backed by Rwanda have captured the town of Masisi in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to various reports.

"It is with dismay that we learn of the capture of Masisi centre by the M23," Alexis Bahunga, a member of North Kivu provincial assembly, told the AFP news agency.

He said this "plunges the territory into a serious humanitarian crisis" and urged the government to strengthen the capacity of the army in the region.

One resident told AFP that the M23 had held a meeting of the town's inhabitants, saying they had "come to liberate the country".

The Congolese authorities have not yet commented on the loss of the town.

It is not clear how many people were killed in the fighting between the M23 and the army and pro-government militias. The town was reported to be quiet on Sunday.

Masisi, which has a population of about 40,000, is the capital of the territory of the same name.

It is about 80km (50 miles) north of the North Kivu provincial capital Goma, which the M23 briefly occupied in 2012.

On Friday, the M23 captured the nearby town of Katale.

Last year, there were fears that the M23 would once again march on Goma, a city of about two million people.

However, there was then a lull in fighting until early December when fighting resumed.

In July, Rwanda did not deny a UN report saying it had about 4,000 soldiers fighting alongside the M23 in DR Congo.

It accused the Congolese government of not doing enough to tackle decades of conflict in the east of the country. Rwanda has previously said the authorities in DR Congo were working with some of those responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide against ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus.

The M23, formed as an offshoot of another rebel group, began operating in 2012 ostensibly to protect the Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo which had long complained of persecution and discrimination.

However, Rwanda's critics accuse it of using the M23 to loot eastern DR Congo's minerals such as gold, cobalt and tantalum, which are used to make mobile phones and batteries for electric cars.

Last month, DR Congo said it was suing Apple over the use of such "blood minerals", prompting the tech giant to say it had stopped getting supplies from both countries.

Rwanda has denied being a conduit for the export of illegal minerals from DR Congo.

NZULO, Congo (AP) — The M23 rebel group’s advance toward eastern Congo’s largest city has displaced over 178,000 people in the past two weeks, the United Nations said, as the fighters closed in on Goma on the border with Rwanda.

The M23 has been making significant advances, though it was unclear whether the rebels will try to capture Goma, which they seized in 2012 and controlled for over a week. Congolese authorities said Tuesday its fighters seized the town of Minova, on a key supply route for Goma, a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo in a decades-long conflict that has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced.

Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing the M23, composed of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army over a decade ago. Rwanda’s government denies the claim.

The U.N. humanitarian agency said Tuesday the new mass displacement was caused by fighting around Minova in South Kivu province.

Thousands of people spilled out of packed wooden boats in Goma on Wednesday, some with bundles of belongings strapped around their foreheads.

Displaced people have filled the Nzulo camp on the outskirts of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and home to around 2 million people.

But some people were already leaving the camp as rebels approached.

David Kasereka fled on a motorbike with a child, barely stopping to speak. “We don’t know where we are going, because everywhere, the bombs are following us,” he told The Associated Press.

Nadège Bauma, like many in Nzulo, was first displaced due to intense fighting in the town of Sake. Inside the camp, the mother of six gathered what she could of her belongings and piled them into a minibus to flee again.

“We just learned that the M23 have arrived in Ngwiro (about 19 miles or 30 kilometers west of Goma) and we decided to leave the area because bullets and bombs are falling,” she said.

The provincial governor of South Kivu, Jean-Jacques Purusi, confirmed the capture of Minova, adding that the rebels have also taken the mining towns of Lumbishi, Numbi and Shanje along with the town of Bweremana in North Kivu province.

Congo’s military said in a statement Tuesday that the rebels made “breakthroughs” in Minova and Bweremana.

More than 100,000 people have fled five days of fighting in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) between government forces and M23 rebels, UN humanitarian officials said on Wednesday.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the clashes took place in the Masisi area of North Kivu province and left at least two people dead and six wounded, according to OCHA partners.

"In the last quarter of last year, violent attacks by different non-state armed groups have increased in the eastern part of the DRC, resulting in population displacements," the office said.

At the end of December 2024, more than 2.7 million people were displaced in North Kivu province. Between September and December 2024, the UN partners reported at least 138 people killed and more than a hundred others kidnapped.

OCHA said the conflict causes people to be constantly on the move as fighting ceases or resumes, increasing their vulnerabilities. It also affects humanitarian access, and many organisations maintain a limited presence, closely monitoring the security situation to resume operations.

The office called on all parties to the conflict and those with influence over them to ensure the safety of civilians and humanitarians and ensure unhindered and unimpeded humanitarian activities. Stephane Dujarric, chief spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the special envoy for the Great Lakes region, Huang Xia, also expressed concern at the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the eastern part of the DRC.

Dujarric said Huang urged the parties to the conflict to prioritize dialogue within the framework of the Luanda and Nairobi regional peace processes and to refrain from any acts likely to constitute violations of national and regional commitments made under the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for the DRC and the region.

The resurgence of the M23 rebels in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has led to renewed conflict in a region historically plagued by instability. The group, predominantly made up of ethnic Tutsi fighters, was originally disbanded in 2013 but re-emerged in 2021, causing significant violence, displacement, and regional tension. The M23 has been accused of numerous human rights abuses, posing a substantial threat to the fragile peace in the Great Lakes region. The group was initially formed in 2012 by a faction of the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP), a rebel group that had previously fought against the Congolese government. The CNDP was integrated into the Congolese national army as part of a 2009 peace agreement, but many former fighters felt the government failed to uphold its commitments, leading to the creation of the M23. The M23 quickly gained notoriety for its ability to seize and hold territory, including the major city of Goma in 2012. However, by 2013, the group was defeated by the Congolese army and a United Nations Intervention Brigade, forcing its fighters to flee to Rwanda and Uganda. Despite this defeat, the underlying grievances of the Tutsi community in eastern Congo, including fears of persecution and marginalization, were never fully addressed, setting the stage for the group’s eventual resurgence.

The Resurgence.

In late 2021, reports emerged of M23 fighters regrouping and launching new attacks in the North Kivu province. By early 2022, the group had reclaimed significant territory, leading to the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians and reigniting ethnic tensions in the region. The resurgence of M23 has been attributed to various factors, including the failure of the Congolese government to address long-term solutions for ethnic reconciliation, continued interference from neighboring Rwanda, and the ongoing struggles with governance and corruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The M23’s resurgence has worsened the already dire humanitarian situation in eastern Congo. According to the United Nations, over 450,000 people have been displaced due to the renewed fighting, adding to the millions already displaced by decades of conflict. Recent clashes between the rebels and army forces have escalated, forcing communities to seek safety on the outskirts of Goma. By the end of May 2022, 72,000 people had been displaced in Rwanda. President Kagame has accused both Congo’s army and the United Nations Stabilization Mission in DRC (MONUSCO) of collaborating with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, whose leaders took part in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.

In response to the resurgence of attacks by M23 rebels in the eastern region of DRC, the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) has started contributing groups to its mission. However, peacekeepers deployed to eastern Congo as part of the SADC mission were killed and wounded by rebel mortar fire during an attack, raising concerns about the effectiveness of the Southern African Mission in DRC (SAMIDR) in reducing conflict. Despite the challenges, the international community has been assisting DRC towards peace. For example, Kenya has recently deployed the Kenya Defense Forces to join MONUSCO in Congo for further stabilization efforts.

International and Government Response.

The re-emergence of the M23 rebel group has sparked widespread outrage from the global community. International organizations such as the United Nations, African Union, and European Union have united in demanding an immediate ceasefire and encouraging the Congolese government to seek peaceful resolutions. The UN’s MONUSCO (United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) has been actively involved in trying to stabilize the region. MONUSCO has provided support to the Congolese army in their operations against the M23 and has worked to protect civilians caught in the conflict. Despite criticism over its effectiveness, MONUSCO continues to play a crucial role in mitigating the impact of the conflict. Additionally, Western nations, including the United States, have imposed sanctions on prominent M23 figures and individuals suspected of aiding the group from Rwanda. Rwanda’s involvement in the conflict has been a contentious issue, with the Rwandan government consistently refuting accusations of supporting the M23 rebel group.

The ongoing dispute has strained relations between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Tshisekedi’s administration has initiated multiple military offensives to retake territory captured by the rebels. However, these efforts have been hindered by poor coordination within the military and the challenging terrain of eastern Congo. Furthermore, the government has enlisted the help of local militias, known as “Mai-Mai,” to support the fight against M23, resulting in further complexities and instances of human rights abuses. Despite facing many challenges, there have been efforts to address the root causes of the conflict. In 2023, the DRC government began new peace talks with the M23, facilitated by the East African Community (EAC) which focused on integrating M23 fighters into the national army, protecting minority communities, and fairly distributing resources in the region. However, progress has been slow, with the M23 still launching attacks while the negotiations are ongoing.

Way Forward

The Congolese government must strengthen its commitment to governance reforms, including improving the rule of law and ensuring that the military is well-trained and equipped to protect civilians. Additionally, there needs to be a greater focus on ethnic reconciliation and the protection of minority communities, particularly the Tutsi population, who have been historically marginalized in the region. Regional cooperation is also crucial. The DRC must work with neighboring countries, including Rwanda and Uganda, to address cross-border issues and prevent external support for rebel groups. This could involve confidence-building measures, joint security operations, and the establishment of mechanisms for peaceful dispute resolution. The international community continues to support peace efforts in the DRC through diplomatic engagement, targeted sanctions, and the provision of humanitarian aid. There should also be more such as the Nairobi and the Luanda process which focuses more on disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) programs for former combatants. These programs should provide alternative livelihoods and address the root causes of recruitment into armed groups.

After Rwanda-backed rebels seized the Congolese city of Goma in 2012, powerful nations across the world registered their disapproval, announcing sanctions against Rwanda and other measures that led to the rebels’ defeat a year later.

When those same rebels battled to capture Goma on Sunday, several nations once again voiced their criticism, but they have yet to apply the level of pressure on Rwanda that eventually led the rebels to stand down more than a decade ago.

As hundreds of thousands of civilians fled escalating violence in recent days, seeking sanctuary in Goma, the rebel group M23 was right behind them. M23, which the United Nations and others say is funded and armed by Rwanda, declared that it had captured Goma early on Monday.

South Africa's military has said nine soldiers were killed, with Malawi and Uruguay also reporting deaths. The M23 advance on Goma in eastern Congo has reportedly been repelled.

South Africa, Malawi and Uruguay have announced that soldiers from their respective armies were killed as they battled to halt the advance of M23 rebel fighters in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The South African National Defense Force (SANDF) said nine of its soldiers were killed on Saturday during a pitched battle with M23 fighters as they attempted to advance on the city of Goma, the key city in the mineral-rich east.

South African military says M23 advance halted

"The M23 hostile forces had launched a full-scale attack on our troops with the intention of taking over Goma but were unable to advance due to the heroic resistance put up by our gallant fighters," the SANDF said in a statement.

South Africa's military said its forces were able to halt the advance and push the M23 rebels back.

The SANDF said the number of injured had yet to be confirmed, and some had varying degrees of injuries.

Two of the killed South African soldiers were part of the UN peacekeeping force, while the other seven South Africans were part of the Southern African Development Community Mission, also known as SAMIDRC.

"The rebel group M23 attacked the SAMIDRC in Goma to which SAMIDRC retaliated and successfully repelled the armed group," the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Secretariat posted on X .

"SADC commends the actions of the brave men and women from SAMIDRC who sacrificed their lives for the Region," it added.

Malawian, Uruguayan soldiers also killed

Before South Africa's military confirmed the number of its dead, the Malawi Defence Force said three of its soldiers had been killed.

"We confirm the loss of three of our courageous soldiers who were part of the SADC Mission in the DRC," said spokesman Emmanuel Mlelemba.

"These soldiers fell in the line of duty during an encounter with the M23 rebel group operating in eastern DRC. As the situation remains volatile, further details will be shared later," he added.

A Uruguayan member of the UN peacekeeping force was also killed while four others were wounded, Uruguay's military announced.

UN Security Council reschedules emergency meeting to Sunday

The UN Security Council has moved an emergency meeting from Monday to Sunday, following a request from Kinshasa.

Diplomats said the emergency talks would take place at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).

The head of the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo, Bintou Keita, is expected to speak.

Kinshasa has also announced it was pulling its diplomats from Kigali, according to a letter from the Foreign Ministry to the Rwandan Embassy dated January 24.

The UN peacekeeping force, also known as MONUSCO, entered Congo more than two decades ago and has around 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground.

Experts from Congo, the United States and the UN have accused Rwanda of backing the M23 armed group. The rebels are mainly composed of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army over a decade ago.

The volatile situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo has a long history. Here's what you need to know.

Surging violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has ignited fears of large-scale instability in one of Africa's most conflict-ridden countries.

On January 27, the M23 rebel group, backed by soldiers from neighboring Rwanda, seized control of Goma, the largest city in eastern DRC. Home to around 1 million people, Goma plays an essential role in the country's economy and administration.

Further adding to the chaos was a massive jailbreak at the city's main prison that occurred on Monday. It resulted in over 4,000 inmates escaping onto the streets and residents locking themselves indoors for safety.

Protestors also attacked the Belgian, Dutch, Kenyan, Ugandan and US embassies, demanding the International community pressure Rwanda over its alleged involvement.

DW explores the conflict's complexities, including Rwanda's controversial role in the DRC and the potential for broader regional unrest.

What is the conflict in eastern Congo?

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has a wealth of natural resources, including metals and minerals such as gold, tin and coltan, essential for manufacturing mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles.

The resources have sparked a cycle of corruption and bloodshed as armed groups, local militias and foreign actors vie for control of the territory. The DRC has been rocked by conflict for more than 30 years since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

The country's citizens have been left to suffer the consequences. Armed conflicts have internally displaced over 7 million people. Human rights organizations have reported widespread atrocities, including massacres, sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers.

At the heart of the current crisis is the resurgence of the M23 rebel group led by ethnic Tutsi. The armed group quickly gained power in 2012 and seized the city of Goma but was expelled by the Congolese army and UN forces in 2013. M23 took up arms once again in 2021, claiming to protect the Tutsi population in eastern Congo from discrimination and violence.

However, DRC leaders in Kinshasa, the capital, say the group is merely a proxy for external forces striving to gain control of the country's rich mineral resources, especially in territories bordering Rwanda and Uganda.

There are currently over 100 different armed groups seeking a foothold in the eastern DRC. Efforts to pacify the region, including a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and M23 rebels signed in 2013 in Nairobi, have repeatedly failed.

What role does Rwanda play?

Rwanda's involvement in the DRC is a point of international tension. Rwandan leaders have repeatedly denied supporting the M23 rebels, but since 2012, UN experts and human rights organizations state explicitly that Rwanda supports M23 in the form of providing logistics, weapons and even personnel.



In part, this history has origins in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, during which 800,000 people, primarily from the Tutsi community, were slaughtered by ethnic Hutu extremists. The genocide ended with Rwanda's current president, Paul Kagame, leading a force of Tutsu rebels. Many Hutu then fled across the border to the DR Congo.

Kagame has called for the need to neutralize the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a Hutu rebel group operating in eastern DRC. His government claims some members of this group who participated in the 1994 genocide pose a direct threat to Rwanda's security.

However, the DRC government accuses Rwanda of using the conflict as a cover for exploiting its natural resources, particularly in areas controlled by M23.

Mineral trade, including the illegal trafficking of gold and coltan, is a lucrative business that allegedly benefits Rwanda while destabilizing the DRC.

Dr. Hassan Khannenje, the Director of the HORN International Institute for Strategic Studies, told DW that Rwanda is unlikely to leave the DRC in peace anytime soon.

"Rwanda has, is, and will always be involved in the DRC. The country is of strategic and national interest to Rwanda, so it's not only about the minerals," he told DW. "However, the minerals tend to fuel the fire," he added. Khannenje said competing rebel groups give additional "rationale to occupy parts of DRC."

The diplomatic fallout has been severe. On January 26, the DRC severed diplomatic ties with Rwanda. Regional efforts to mediate have yielded little progress.

Could the conflict escalate?

According to the UN, the conflict in the DRC can potentially escalate into a broader regional crisis. However, some experts, including Khannenje, say it is unlikely.

"What we may see is perhaps just an escalation of the fighting parties — that's the government (of the DRC) as well as M23 — and some increased support either from countries in the region or from outside of it," Khannenje said.

Uganda, like Rwanda, has also been accused of backing armed groups in eastern Congo, though it denies these claims.

Meanwhile, refugees from North Kivu in eastern DRC are already fleeing to neighboring countries, heightening fears of cross-border instability.

Sanctions have been imposed on M23 leaders, and there have been warnings against foreign interference.

However, the global response remains muted, leaving African nations to bear the brunt of the conflict's consequences. The stakes are dire for the DRC's population of over 100 million people.

Humanitarian organizations warn that the violence could lead to famine, outbreak of disease, and further mass displacement. Without urgent action, the conflict risks spiraling into a large-scale tragedy with consequences for the entire region.

France has led European Union condemnation of attacks on embassies in Kinshasa. Germany said it had canceled planned consultations with Rwanda over alleged support for the M23 rebels, whose advance sparked the violence.

The European Union on Tuesday condemned attacks on foreign embassies in the Democratic Republic of Congo amid increasing violence centered on the city of Goma in the county's east.

A spokesman for the EU's foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas said in Brussels that the bloc was calling for the protection of diplomatic missions in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot specifically condemned an attack on France's embassy in the capital, Kinshasa.

"These attacks are unacceptable. Everything is being done to ensure the safety of our personnel and our citizens," he said.

The Belgian, Dutch, Kenyan, Rwandan, Ugandan and US embassies have also been attacked by protesters as hundreds of thousands of people flee amid fighting in the eastern part of the country.

US citizens urged to leave

"Due to an increase in violence throughout the city of Kinshasa, the US Embassy in Kinshasa advises US citizens to shelter-in-place and then safely depart while commercial options are available," read a statement from the US Embassy, urging US citizens to leave the country.

"Please be aware that there may be roadblocks and protests on the road to the airport which could impact travel time and security."

Police fired teargas as protesters marched to the embassies in Kinshasa, looting or setting fires to parts of diplomatic buildings.

Kinshasa resembles 'battlefield'

Reporting from Kinshasa, DW correspondent Jonas Gerding said parts of the city resembled a "battlefield."

"People were gathering … and they started to set the Rwandan embassy on fire … they started to burn tires, they started to riot," he reported.

"The police came and started to disperse the crowds with shots, the crowds moved on and began looting supermarkets. By the end of the day, the city looked devastated."

Rebel offensive in Goma sparks protest

The protests are in response to the advance of Rwanda-backed M23 rebels into Goma, a major city in the country's conflict-torn east.

Protesters are demanding that the international community pressure Rwanda over its alleged involvement.

"We denounce the hypocrisy of the international community," Timothee Tshishimbi, one of the protesters.

"They must tell Rwanda to stop this adventure."

A spokesman for Germany's development ministry said on Tuesday it had "canceled government consultations planned for February with Rwanda" and was "coordinating with other donors about further measures."

A statement read: "There can be no business as usual amid the current escalation. Talks on development cooperation can only resume when Rwanda and M23 end the escalation and withdraw."

Rebels advance in Goma

On Tuesday, Corneille Nangaa, leader of the AFC rebel alliance that includes M23, told Reuters news agency that Goma airport was in rebel hands, which was also confirmed by diplomatic and security sources.

"They have taken control of the airport, M23 fighters are there," another security source told the AFP news agency, adding that "more than 1,200 Congolese soldiers have surrendered."

Some protesters also claim that foreign nations are complicit in the incursion, which the Congolese government says also includes Rwandan troops.

The M23 rebels are among 100 armed groups seeking a foothold in the mineral-rich region.

Congolese security forces are seeking to slow the insurgents who advanced into Goma in recent days.

The M23 rebels temporarily took over Goma in 2012 but were forced to withdraw under international pressure.

They re-emerged in late 2021 with increasing support from Rwanda, according to Congo's government and United Nations experts.

DR Congo rebels vow to march all the way to capital

The rebel leader whose fighters have captured Goma, the biggest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, has vowed to continue their offensive all the way to the capital, Kinshasa. Corneille Nangaa, who heads an alliance of rebel groups that includes the M23, said their ultimate aim was to topple President Félix Tshisekedi's government. Unconfirmed reports say the Rwanda-backed rebels are currently advancing towards Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the mineral-rich east, despite international calls for a ceasefire. In a televised address after the fall of Goma, Tshisekedi said a "vigorous and coordinated response" was under way to recapture territory from the rebels.

"Be sure of one thing: the Democratic Republic of Congo will not let itself be humiliated or crushed. We will fight and we will triumph," he said on Wednesday evening. The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. On Thursday, Nangaa presented the rebels as the new administrators of Goma, telling journalists they were there to stay and would get services up and running again. Since fighting escalated last week, electricity and water supplies in the city have been cut off, and food is scarce. What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?

South Africa and Rwanda go head-to-head over DR Congo war

The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo "We will continue the march of liberation all the way to Kinshasa," Nangaa added. Analysts say such an offensive would be unlikely given the vast size of the country - Kinshasa is 2,600km (1,600 miles) away. However, it did happen in 1997, when Rwanda-backed forces ousted long-time leader Mobutu Sese Seko. Nangaa's comments will increase anger in Kinshasa, which has accused neighbouring Rwanda of backing the rebels, and even having its troops in Goma. Rwanda is also facing a chorus of international criticism, despite its denials of direct military support. M23 - the main rebel group in the alliance - is led by ethnic Tutsis, and says it took up arms to protect the rights of the minority group in DR Congo. Rwanda's President Paul Kagame is also a Tutsi, and accuses DR Congo's government of harbouring Hutu militias who were involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.

Both the UN and the southern African regional bloc Sadc have peacekeepers in the east, but they failed to halt the rebel assault. Peacekeepers from several counties have been killed in the conflict, with South African troops suffering the highest casualties - 13. On Wednesday, Kagame said Rwanda was ready for a confrontation with South Africa if necessary, following a claim by President Cyril Ramaphosa that M23 fighters and Rwandan forces were responsible for the deaths. In a strongly worded statement on X, Kagame accused Ramaphosa of distorting their private conversations. "If South Africa wants to contribute to peaceful solutions, that is well and good, but South Africa is in no position to take on the role of a peacemaker or mediator. And if South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day," he said. The exchange marks a significant escalation in tensions between the two nations, whose relationship has been fragile for several years. Southern African leaders are due to hold a summit on Friday, with Kagame saying their regional force was "not a peacekeeping force, and it has no place in this situation". In contrast, Tshisekedi paid tribute to the killed Sadc soldiers "fighting alongside us", as well as UN peacekeepers. The UN, the European Union and countries including the US and China have all called on Rwandan forces to leave DR Congo. The UK and Germany are among donor countries that have threatened to withdraw their aid to Rwanda in the wake of the M23 offensive. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Wednesday that £32m ($40m) of annual bilateral aid was under threat, while Germany has cancelled aid talks with the country.

Fierce fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has displaced more than half a million people, the country's foreign minister told an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.

More than 500,000 people have been displaced thus far in January due to heavy fighting in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the country's foreign minister told an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday.

"The humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, with more than 500,000 new (internally displaced people) in North and South Kivu provinces in January alone," Congolese Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner said.

In the worst escalation of a long-running conflict in more than a decade, Rwandan-backed M23 rebels entered Goma, the capital of North Kivu and the largest city in eastern Congo, on Monday. Large parts of the city are now under rebel control.

MONUSCO calls for international action

Meanwhile, the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) has called for international intervention as violence escalates.

"The situation in Goma requires urgent and coordinated international action," Vivian van de Perre, deputy special Representative for Protection and Operations in the MONUSCO, told the UN Security Council in New York.

"These attacks continue to ravage the city, killing, injuring, traumatizing and displacing civilians and exacerbating the crisis," he said, adding that the UN peacekeeping mission had taken in a large number of people seeking protection in Goma.

Rubio urges ceasefire in call with Kagame

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Rwandan President Paul Kagame in a phone call that Washington was "deeply troubled" by the escalation of the conflict in the Congo, particularly the fall of the city of Goma to Rwandan-backed rebels.

The top US diplomat "urged an immediate ceasefire in the region, and for all parties to respect sovereign territorial integrity," a State Department statement said.

Goma is located in one of the most resource-rich areas of the DRC and borders Rwanda. The M23 rebel militia has been fighting Congolese government troops and allied militias for years, seeking access to natural resources.

According to the European Union, the total number of displaced people in the country is now estimated at more than 7 million.

analysis

A shifting political calculus by sponsors of the M23 rebel group risk triggering another war in the Great Lakes Region, underscoring the importance of African mediators and global partners acting quickly to stem the fighting.

The fall of Goma to the March 23 Movement (M23) rebels has sent shock waves through the region and risks triggering a wider regional war. Memories remain fresh of the devastating Congo Wars of the late 1990s and early 2000s in which 7 African militaries intervened, and an estimated 5.4 million Congolese died.

The development is particularly alarming because it is widely recognized that M23 is backed by the Rwanda Defense Force (RDF) in support of Rwandan interests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). In addition to the estimated 6,000 M23 troops, there are approximately 4,000 Rwandan forces forces currently in the DRC. There is also evidence from UN investigations that M23 is receiving support from Uganda. Reports indicate that Congolese troops, government-aligned militias known as Wazalendo, and foreign mercenaries have surrendered to RDF troops in the DRC.

The fall of Goma to March 23 Movement (M23) rebels has sent shock waves through the region and risks triggering a wider regional war.

The well-planned and executed seizure of Goma, the capital of the strategic and mineral-rich North Kivu Province in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), continues a widening offensive by M23 since 2022 to seize control of territory in the eastern DRC. This has been accompanied by efforts to establish a parallel civilian administration in areas M23 controls as well as expanded mineral extraction. This suggests that the rebel group and their regional backers have longer term objectives in holding and potentially expanding their territorial control.

The attacks have set off a major humanitarian crisis with displaced people fleeing farther south in the already unstable South Kivu, or across the Rwanda border. According to the UN, over 500,000 people have been displaced since January and hospitals are overwhelmed with casualties, many of them civilians. Shops and businesses are being ransacked. Heavy ordnance is landing in civilian areas. At least 17 peacekeepers have been killed including those from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) who are serving in the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO).

Congolese President Félix is under enormous pressure to respond to the aggression popularly believed to be driven by Rwanda and Uganda. Hundreds of angry protesters in Kinshasa are demanding the government take immediate and decisive action to reclaim the lost territory. Some have set off fires in front of Western embassies out of frustration over the international community’s failure to stop the violence. Others are calling for weapons so they can join the fight in the east.

Calls for an immediate ceasefire and the pullout of Rwandan troops have come from the UN, European Union, and the United States. Kenyan President William Ruto and his Angolan counterpart, João Lourenço, both of whom have been mediating a multi-track process between Rwanda and the DRC known respectively as the Nairobi and Luanda Processes, called for a return to negotiations without preconditions.

Who is the M23?

The March 23 Movement was founded in 2012 by a group of former soldiers from the now defunct Congrès national pour la défense du peuple (CNDP), which had broken away from the national army in 2009 following the collapse of a peace treaty signed on March 23 of that year. The peace treaty provided for their integration into the regular military and measures to address the nationality of the Congolese of Rwandan origin, known as Banyarwanda, commonly called “Banyamulenge.”

The former CNDP members regrouped to form M23, claiming to defend the Banyamulenge and combat the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR)—the mostly Hutu remnants of those implicated in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, principally the Interahamwe and ex-Rwandan Armed Forces.

M23 also has roots in the rebel movements sponsored by Rwanda and Uganda during the First Congo War (1996-1997) against Mobutu Sese Seko, and the Second Congo War against Laurent Kabila (1998-2003). Rwanda’s campaigns in the DRC recruited heavily from the Banyamulenge, tapping grievances around nationality and mobilizing kinship ties.

Meanwhile, a third of Yoweri Museveni’s National Resistance Army and Movement (NRM/NRA) during Uganda’s civil war (1980-1986) was composed of Rwandan immigrants and refugees, as well as Ugandan Banyarwanda. They rose to the top of Uganda’s security apparatus and would later play a central role in the formation of the largely Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Army that fought against the Hutu-led forces perpetuating genocide in Rwanda in 1994. Its leadership would go on to form the basis of Rwanda’s present government.

This historical backdrop explains some of the motivations and recruitment patterns of the Rwandan-backed groups that comprise the M23. They have used messages of self-preservation and safety against persecution to appeal to Banyamulenge communities. Since its resurgence in 2022, it has sought to appeal to other communities and set its sights on national goals like overthrowing the Congolese government. In 2024, M23 merged with 17 political parties and several armed groups to form the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), which is led by Corneille Nangaa, who hails from western DRC. Nangaa served as president of the Independent National Electoral Commission from 2015 to 2021.

What Happens in Congo Doesn’t Stay in Congo

The fall of Goma could start another extended period of instability for large parts of the country. The Congo wars of the 1990s and 2000s also started in eastern DRC, with key epicenters in Kisangani, Bunia, Bukavu, and Goma. Eventually seven African militaries were engaged. Concerns that Rwanda, with roughly 10 percent of the population size as the DRC, would gain disproportionate influence over one of the largest countries in Africa with nine neighbors, underpins the regional anxiety. The regionalization of the conflict, in turn, complicates efforts to find solutions to what are essentially political and social problems.

The fall of Goma is reminiscent of a previous seizure of the strategic city by M23, back in 2012. This time, however, is much different.

The fall of Goma is reminiscent of a previous seizure of the strategic city by M23, back in 2012. This time, however, is much different. The group appears to be larger, better trained, organized, and armed. Since its resurgence in 2022, M23 has carried out a series of lighting offensives, capturing large parts of North and South Kivu. The weaponry it used includes surface to air missiles, combat drones, and heavy artillery—lending credence to the finding that they received significant state backing. “Their uniforms, their equipment—they are not dressed like a ragtag army. I was a guerrilla fighter myself, so I know what guerrilla fighters look like,” notes South African retired army general, Maomela Moreti Motau. “They are clearly supported by a powerful force.”

Back in 2012, M23 withdrew in the face of massive African and international pressure. This concerted political, diplomatic, and military leverage changed the calculus of M23 and that of Rwanda. The diplomatic environment this time around also appears to be different. Major international partners are distracted and there is a lack of coordination among them and regional countries. The military dynamics on the ground have also changed. “The main actors involved do not seem to be deterred by admonitions by major global powers. What we are seeing now is different from before,” notes a retired AU diplomat.

Since 2012, Rwanda has positioned itself as a key regional security provider internationally and regionally as an apparent preemptive measure to mitigate the isolation it faced previously. For example, it has troops in Mozambique to fight an Islamist insurgency. This means southern Africa is unlikely to speak with one voice on Rwanda’s role in the DRC. The East African Community (EAC) had deployed forces to the eastern DRC in 2022 to help stabilize the region in the face of rising M23 activity. However, they were asked to depart within a year by Tshisekedi. The bloc, currently chaired by Kenyan President William Ruto, will therefore need to be mobilized to mount a diplomatic response.

>The region may be witnessing the start of a campaign aimed at achieving a larger set of military objectives and, potentially building new alliances.

The ever-shifting regional alignments among Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, and the DRC are another complicating factor. Rwanda has accused the DRC and Burundi, which has as many as 10,000 troops and government militia known as the Imbonerakure in the east, of working with the FDLR and other groups like the Wazalendo militia. There are widespread fears among many on the ground in Bukavu in South Kivu—where Burundian soldiers are located—that violence will erupt at any time as more Congo troops retreat there by boat from Goma.

Bukavu is already the epicenter of clashes between Burundian rebel groups and the Burundian military. The Ruzizi Plain, which faces Burundi’s commercial capital, Bujumbura, is also a focus of these tensions. The potential that the escalation of fighting in the Kivus triggers a wider regional conflict, therefore, is high.

With the M23 practically controlling all of North Kivu and pressing deeper into South Kivu, the region may be witnessing the start of a campaign aimed at achieving a larger set of military objectives and potentially building new alliances.

The assault on Goma has also occurred in a changed security context. Former staunch allies turned bitter rivals and now diplomatic partners, Uganda and Rwanda do not seem to be as opposed to each other as they were when M23 seized the city back in 2012. In 2014, about 1,000 M23 fighters vanished from a military base in western Uganda where they were cantoned following their breakup in 2013 (a smaller force was disarmed and cantoned in Rwanda). Then in 2021, Uganda, through an agreement with the DRC, began constructing new roads, bridges, and other infrastructure in North Kivu, from Bunagana to Rutshuru, Goma, and down to the Rwandan border.

Uganda and Rwanda have a long history of military intervention in the DRC, first as allies during the First Congo War under a joint military command against the longtime Congolese dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. They were then rivals when they fought on Congolese soil in support of rival movements seeking to overthrow the Congolese government of Laruent Kabila during the Second Congo War. It is hard to predict how the two neighbors, whose top military staff had a flurry of exchanges in recent months, will relate to each other in the latest flare-up.

An underlying economic factor to all of the DRC’s multiple and complex conflicts is the Congo’s vast mineral wealth, particularly in the east. The region is a major source of coltan, cobalt, tantalum and lithium, which are crucial components for modern communication devices. Rwanda, in particular, is alleged to be facilitating the illicit mining and trafficking of these minerals. The market value for these minerals is likely to exceed over $1 billion. This represents another driver of the conflict that will need to be addressed if a comprehensive peace is to be achieved.

Averting a Regional War

There are many unknowns in the rapidly changing crisis in the eastern DRC. One factor remains constant, however. The underlying political, social, and economic drivers that have fueled the instability do not lend themselves to a military solution. There is already a framework in place to address the DRC’s internal conflicts—including the issue of citizenship and nationality—and the external dimensions of the crisis involving neighboring countries. The Sun City Accords, concluded as part of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue (ICD) between 2001 and 2003, created a template for a comprehensive peace that addressed the root causes of Congo’s complex political and social conflicts. The parallel, Lusaka Peace Accord, addressed the external elements of the crisis.

The Ituri Pacification Committee, which flowed from both processes, localized the peace building framework in the volatile region of Ituri, paving the way for the establishment of the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR)—a mechanism for UN engagement in support of the commitment of each of the parties.

The immediate challenge is to create the political will for de-escalation so that these dialogues can regain traction.

Some of this institutional memory and experience has been revitalized in two concurrent processes designed to bring Rwanda and the DRC into a political dialogue: the Luanda process, chaired by Angolan President João Lourenço, and the Nairobi process, supervised by Kenyan President William Ruto.

The immediate challenge is to create the political will for de-escalation so that these dialogues can regain traction and the frameworks for addressing the underlying drivers revitalized.

As fighting between M23 rebels and the Congolese armed forces intensifies, Western governments have urged their citizens to leave the main city of Goma.

The M23 rebel group killed a governor as they moved through eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Congolese army confirmed Friday.

The governor of Congo's North Kivu province, Peter Cirimwami, has died from injuries sustained during fighting on the front line, according to the military spokesperson.

As the fighting between M23 and Congolese armed forces intensifies, the UK, US, and France on Friday urged their citizens to leave Goma in North Kivu province while airports and borders were still open.

The Western governments warned that the situation could worsen rapidly as M23 encircled Goma, a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts that lies close to the border with Rwanda.

Increased fighting in DRC

The United Nations mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUSCO) said Friday that its peacekeepers have "been actively engaged in intense combat" against M23 forces.

"Over the past 48 hours MONUSCO heavy artillery fire carried out fire missions against M23 positions," the UN said.

UN chief Antonio Guterres was "alarmed by the resumption of hostilities," his spokesman said in a statement on Thursday.

The M23 group has been making significant territorial gains in the mineral-rich eastern DRC in recent weeks.

Earlier this month, rebels seized the towns of Minova, Katale, and Masisi, west of Goma.

Who is M23?

M23 takes its name from an agreement between the Congolese government and previous rebels signed on March 23, 2009. The group said the government had violated the deal.

The rebels are mainly composed of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army over a decade ago.

M23 is one of around 100 armed groups that have been trying to get a foothold in Congo. The decades-long conflict has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises.

UN: Congo conflict displaces over 400,000

The UN said the conflict in the North Kivu province had displaced over 400,000 people this year.

"The number of displacements is now over 400,000 people this year alone, almost double the number reported last week," Matthew Saltmarsh, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), said Friday.

Saltmarsh warned the UNHCR is "gravely concerned about the safety and security of civilians and internally displaced people" in the east.

"Heavy bombardments caused families from at least nine displacement sites on the periphery of Goma to flee into the city to seek safety and shelter," he added.

Fighting between the Democratic Republic of Congo’s national army and the rebel group M23 has displaced thousands of people in the eastern border city of Goma. Formed 10 years ago, the Rwanda-backed Mouvement du 23 Mars (M23) soon made its first mark when it briefly occupied Goma, a city of 1 million today. An African-led effort resulted in a ceasefire and M23’s demobilisation – until the resumption of hostilities in 2021. Delphin Ntanyoma sets out the four things you should know about the rebel insurgency, which threatens regional stability.

1. What is the background to M23’s insurgency in eastern DRC?

The current force is what’s left of the original M23 Movement formed in April 2012. M23 was an offspring of the National Congress for the Defence of the People, better known by its French acronym CNDP, a rebel group which fought the DRC government between 2006 and 2009. Both groups draw on a claim that the Congolese Tutsi and other ethnic communities in north and south Kivu are discriminated against. They are considered of Rwandan descent and are commonly referred to as “Rwandophones”. One of the consequences of this discrimination is the presence of tens thousands of refugees in the Africa Great Lakes region.

M23 occupied the city of Goma in eastern DRC for 10 days in 2012. The rapid rise and its links to Rwanda caused alarm and triggered international efforts for a ceasefire. After talks brokered by the Southern African Development Community, M23 ended its rebellion in 2013.

Infighting soon erupted within M23 between two groups. One wing made up of roughly 1,700 soldiers fled to Uganda. The other smaller wing of 700 fighters fled to Rwanda. Many of those fighters thereafter demobilised voluntarily or negotiated their way into the DRC’s national army.

Early in 2017, a few hundred remnants of the Uganda wing left Uganda for the DRC, where they sometimes clashed with the DRC’s national army. But there was no sign of intense recruitment until 2021 when the rebel group resumed attacks.

It is extremely hard to estimate how large the M23 group is currently. Still, this is a region that has been volatile for decades and where countless unresolved grievances simmer under the surface. There are hundreds if not thousands of young men who constitute a ready reservoir for recruitment and mobilisation.

Nonetheless, the M23’s ability to occupy and control several localities in North Kivu with its limited military force has led many experts to believe that the rebel group has received military support from Rwanda and to a lesser extent Uganda. DRC government has strongly opposed any form of peace talks with M23.

2. What territory do they seek to capture and why?

The majority of M23 rebel combatants originate from North Kivu province and specifically from Masisi and Rutshuru. These territories are close to the border of Rwanda where fighting takes place. They are extremely familiar with this terrain and might enjoy local support from inhabitants. The city of Goma is also within this vicinity.

The area of Rutshuru territory alone is approximately 5,300km², equivalent to a fifth of Rwandan territory. The region occupied by M23 borders Rwanda, Uganda, and DRC and has a huge traffic of commercial trucks carrying goods from the Kenyan port of Mombasa through Uganda to Goma and Bukavu in the DRC. Controlling the border town of Bunagana – as M23 curently does – provides an opportunity to raise additional funds through informal taxation. The region is also rich in terms of natural (forest and mineral) resources. In the past, access and control of these resources have also motivated several actors to support rebel groups.

While moving closer to the City of Goma and based on the 2012 experience, M23 may not seek to easily capture the city. The city harbours a million inhabitants, including hundreds of thousands of internally displaced. Fighting near Goma exerts pressure on the Congolese government to open dialogue. But attacking the city would increase more international pressure against rebels and Rwanda.

3. What’s behind their battlefield success against the national army?

Mathias Gillmann, spokesperson for the UN stabilisation mission in the DRC, hinted at their strength as recently as July 2022. He noted the M23 was militarily stronger than in the past.

the M23 operates more and more like a conventional army, relying on equipment that is much more sophisticated than in the past.

Though it has not yet been independently verified, M23 is among the groups thought capable of shooting down a UN mission helicopter that crashed within their stronghold in March 2022. DRC military helicopters were also targeted in this area in 2017.

Military sources have hinted that M23 is currently able to operate around the clock, thanks to night vision devices and equipment. It also has longer-range weapons, such as mortars and machine guns. It’s likely these would have been supplied by a well organised army, which is why Rwanda security services are suspected of supporting M23.

Besides equipment, M23 is fighting a well-organised conventional war in which it has intimidated the national army. It advanced quickly from Sarabwe forest reserve to Bunagana. More recently rebels were in action within 20km of Goma City.

However, it’s also important to understand that the DRC’s national army is extremely dysfunctional, corrupt, ill-equipped and low on morale. It is well known that soldiers’ rations disappear into the hands of the generals. In many cases, soldiers can spend days without logistical support simply because senior officers and military generals are more concerned with accumulating resources even at the expense of their rank and file soldiers.

4. What happens next?

Let’s start with the context. The political agreement that ended M23’s occupation of Goma 10 years ago was never fully implemented. Its combatants should have been integrated into the Congolese national army but were not. And the M23 political wing was to become a recognised political party but was not.

The DRC government, first under President Joseph Kabila and now President Felix Tshisekedi, opted to politically engage its main sponsor, Rwanda formally or informally. Rwanda’s involvement in the DRC dates back to 1996 when it backed the rebellion that toppled long-time ruler Mobutu Sese Seko. Its subsequent involvement through proxies such as M23 has both security and economic motivations.

Relations between Kinshasa and Kigali soured recently after Tshisekedi and Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni agreed joint military operations along their border coupled with roads construction. Neighbouring Burundi was also allowed by DRC to pursue rebels across the common border. Burundian rebels operating in DRC have received military and logistical support from Rwanda security services.

This left Rwanda looking isolated in the volatile region. By reactivating M23, President Paul Kagame’s aim was to stir the regional political landscape in which he was feeling increasingly isolated.

For its role, Rwanda has come under intense diplomatic pressure from the international community. This includes key western allies such as the US, the UK and France. Kagame has little choice but to withdraw his military, logistical and political support and get M23 to leave the large area the rebels have occupied. This has happened before. In 2009, CNDP – the precursor to M23 – was dismantled when Kigali secured a deal with Kinshasa that was advantageous to Rwanda but detrimental to the rebel group. In 2013, Kigali again was obliged to withdraw his support to M23 under international pressure.

This time around, Kagame could seek guarantees that the East African Community’s regional force won’t constitute a threat to Rwanda’s security in the same way that a joint operation of Uganda and DRC’s army in North Kivu could have been.

The cost of this to Kagame would be loss of credibility among his shrinking supporters within his Rwandan inner circle . It would also hit his support base, mainly among the Congolese Tutsi in the DRC who count on his support amid violence targeting them in North Kivu.

Rwanda will still remain somewhat isolated in the region. This is because Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Burundi and South Sudan are all allowed the East African Community and DRC specifically to send in their forces to stabilise the Eastern DRC while Rwanda is not.

Rather than back a rebel group and operate through a proxy, Rwanda could still directly intervene across the border with DRC if its security is threatened. But this option requires its security services to show tangible evidence of these threats within the country’s borders.

The former US administration has said the government of Rwandan President Paul Kagame rebuffed a proposed peace incentive for a deal between Congo and Rwanda. It involved expanding the Lobito Corridor to eastern Congo.

M23 rebels are steadily advancing toward Goma, the capital of North Kivu Province in the eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). On Tuesday, M23 captured the eastern city of Minova, one of the main supply routes for Goma. Other parts of North Kivu Province also risk falling to the rebels.

The security situation in the region is deteriorating due to the increasing territorial gains of the militias. Clashes have displaced thousands and triggered a humanitarian crisis.

The Tutsi-led M23 group has been fighting again in the country's east since 2022. The Congolese government in Kinshasa and United Nations experts accuse neighboring Rwanda of supporting the group with Rwandan troops and weapons. Rwanda, however, has never admitted direct military involvement.

What was the US peace incentive?

Molly Phee, the former assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said the US had proposed expanding the Lobito Corridor railway development, to speed up the transport of minerals from southern Congo and Zambia to Angola's Atlantic coast.

"We had proposed to both sides [Rwanda and Congo] that if we could get to stabilization in eastern DRC, we could work on developing a spur from the Lobito Corridor up through eastern DRC," Phee told AFP in an interview ahead of her exit as the Biden administration came to an end. "They did not take that action," Phee said of the Congolese government.

According to the American diplomat, the offer had included a crackdown on the FDLR, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. This Hutu-led rebel group has been active in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has accused the FDLR of seeking to destabilize his country.

"We tried to offer positive incentives. A genuine framework — fundamentally negotiated by the parties — exists, and at the moment, Rwanda seems to have walked away," she said.

Kagame absent during Angola peace talks

Kagame did not participate in the Angola-brokered talks between the heads of state of Congo and Zambia during a visit by then-US President Joe Biden in December 2024.

Alex Vines, director of the Africa Program at Chatham House in London, said the US offer to extend its signature investment of the Lobito Corridor into the troubled eastern Congo as an incentive for a peace deal did not land well.

Vines said this was an "ill-advised gesture" that did not comfort the Rwandans, so they rejected the offer. He added that Rwanda is not interested in seeing trade pass through Congo and the Atlantic coast; it wants trade to pass through Rwanda.

"It's not surprising that Rwanda has backed away from this, as it would not be interested in diverting trade away crossing its own borders going into East Africa," Vines stated. "This was a fraud incentive, it might have been counterproductive."

Rail transport in eastern Congo 'nonsensical'

According to Evans David Wala Chabala, former CEO of the Zambia Securities and Exchange Commission, the US offer does not make sense. He told DW that if Kagame was involved in the conflict in the eastern region of Congo and was accessing the mining products from there, he would not want to transport the minerals via a transport corridor that crosses the entire length of the country.

"He would want to get them out of the country as quickly as possible," said Chabala, now a consultant at the Africa Policy Research Institute.

He said it would be much more viable for Kagame to have transportation that runs from Dar es Salaam to the Tanzanian capital, Dodoma. In June 2024, Tanzania and Rwanda agreed to construct a standard-gauge railway linking Tanzania's Isaka dry port to Rwanda's capital, Kigali. The 521-kilometer (323-mile) railway will cost an estimated $2.5 billion (€1.9 billion).

Trade in valuable raw materials in the region is growing. The International Energy Agency has estimated that demand for nickel and cobalt will increase 20-fold between 2020 and 2040, that of graphite 25-fold and for lithium, a whopping 40-fold, according to a report by Chabala on the Lobito Corridor.

The predicted surge in demand has sparked great interest in the Lobito Corridor, creating an inevitable scramble for access.

Congo endowed with precious minerals

The Democratic Republic of Congo, the world's largest producer of cobalt (estimated at around 70 % of global production), is at the center of this competition, as is Zambia, which is also affected.

The Lobito Corridor comprises a 1,300-km railroad line from the port of Lobito on the Angolan Atlantic coast to the town of Luau on Angola's northeastern border with Congo, to Kolwezi town, near northwestern Zambia.

The railroad line extends 400 km further into Congo to the mining town of Kolwezi. According to the European and American contract partners,who are investing heavily in the infrastructure, the rail link is intended to speed up the transportation of minerals such as cobalt and copper and counteract Chinese influence in the region.

The project is also part of the Western geopolitical strategy in the region, an attempt to counter China's current dominance in the mining sector in Congo and Zambia.

Zambia could act as a transit hub for Congo's minerals

According to Chabala, mineral traders prefer to transport the extracted raw materials from Congo to Zambia, before transporting them out of Africa via the ports.

He added that traders are only paid once the goods reach Zambia's borders. An extension of the Lobito Corridor from Kolwezi to Zambia is being discussed.

"The Democratic Republic of Congo is already a very unsafe place to do business," Chabala said, noting that eastern Congo has been devastated by the 120 groups rebel groups fighting over the resources.

The Zambian analyst does not consider the plan of the former US administration feasible, especially since the new administration under Donald Trump is unlikely to follow suit.

"Joe Biden may have made this proposal to expand the corridor in the eastern region of DRC because he knew full well that he was in the final weeks of his presidency and that the plan would no longer be implemented after this discussion," Chabala said.

The big problem is that Rwanda is one of the main destinations for coltan and other minerals smuggled across Congo’s eastern border. Rwanda exports more minerals for processing and manufacturing than it mines, the U.S. State Department said this month, citing U.N. figures.

The Great Lakes region is of strategic interest to global powers as they hunt for the minerals and metals needed for wind turbines, solar panels and consumer electronics. It is the source of half the world’s tantalum, which is extracted from metallic coltan ore and used in electronic components.

Facing strong pushback after signing the deal, the EU executive has tried to clarify its intentions, POLITICO found in conversations with officials, activists and researchers — arguing the agreement aligns with its human rights agenda by helping to exert pressure on Rwanda to have sustainable supply chains.

“The deal was not sealed, first and foremost, to get access to minerals, but to leverage change on the ground,” said one EU official, who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Rwanda’s wealth, Congo’s riches

Brussels wants not only to catch up with China, but also do a better job of safeguarding high environmental and social standards, and of retaining value in mining countries. In the region, Beijing already maintains close ties with Congo and controls vast parts of its mining sector.

The European Commission calls Rwanda a “major player in the world’s tantalum extraction,” pointing to its output of tin, tungsten, gold and niobium. Rwanda, it said, has the potential to become a “hub for value addition in the mineral sector,” forecasting that the mining industry will increase export revenues to $1.5 billion this year, from $373 million in 2017.

Military personnel in the Democratic Republic of the Congo stepped up patrols in the government stronghold of Goma on Friday, as Rwanda-backed rebels encircled the city.

Residents described the spread of panic as M23 rebels took control of Sake, a town only 27 kilometres (16 miles) from the provincial capital, a day earlier.

Soldiers could be seen checking the identity of passengers and the contents of vehicles.

Patrick Salumana, a local taxi driver, said that to see the soldiers was "reassuring".

"Last night, like this time, there was widespread panic, but today it's like a blessing to see soldiers checking,” he said.

M23 has made significant territorial gains in recent weeks, encircling Goma, which has around 2 million people and is a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts.

The evening patrols came just hours after a military spokesman confirmed the governor of eastern Congo’s North Kivu province had died from injuries sustained during fighting on the front line.

The circumstances around the death of Maj. Gen Peter Cirimwami were unclear.

He was hit during a battle on the front line on Thursday and died of his wounds on Friday.

The news caused an outpouring of concern and grief among the people of Goma.

"To see the governor die on the battlefield hurts us so much," said local resident, Amani Safari.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo, along the border with Rwanda, in a decades-long conflict that has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises.

More than 7 million people have been displaced by the fighting. Earlier this month, M23 captured the towns of Minova, Katale and Masisi, west of Goma.

M23 seized Goma in 2012 and controlled it for over a week.

Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly composed of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army over a decade ago.

Rwanda’s government denies the claim but last year admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a build-up of Congolese forces near the border.

U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo.

With the fall of Goma people face a worst-case scenario in humanitarian terms.

After days of intense fighting, the humanitarian situation in Goma, capital of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), has reached alarming levels - with humanitarian needs now massive and response capacities severely strained.

The World Food Programme (WFP) warned on Thursday that food supplies are running dangerously low, as water and electricity outages exacerbate the crisis.

The seizure and closure of Goma's airport by Rwanda-backed M23 rebels has further interfered with aid delivery, while the blocking of roads and lake transport restrictions have left thousands stranded.

The rebel group has taken control of most of Goma since entering the city on Monday in the biggest escalation of a decades-long conflict springing from the Rwandan genocide against the Tutsis, and a continuing struggle for control of rich mineral resources in the region among a plethora of armed groups.

Fleeing by boat

Families attempting to flee the violence across Lake Kivu are resorting to unsafe makeshift boats, putting their lives at risk.

At the same time, the UN aid coordination office, OCHA, reports that humanitarian workers have been unable to leave their shelters in Goma for over 24 hours due to the insecurity, severely affecting emergency response efforts.

Tom Fletcher, the emergency relief chief, has allocated $17 million from the UN's Central Emergency Relief Fund (CERF) to support lifesaving assistance - yet access to those in need remains uncertain.

Hospitals overwhelmed

Medical facilities in Goma - and second city Bukavu to the south - are overwhelmed, with over 2,000 injuries reported since the beginning of January, including many from gunshot wounds. Hospitals lack adequate medical supplies, fuel and staff to manage the growing influx of patients.

The World Health Organization (WHO), International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) are urgently working to bolster healthcare services, but with supply chains disrupted and facilities at capacity, response efforts are severely strained.

Additionally, health authorities warn of an increasing risk of disease outbreaks, including cholera, measles and mpox, due to mass displacement, unsafe water sources and inadequate sanitation.

Escalating insecurity in North Kivu

In the village of Kiziba, on the outskirts of Goma, civilians are reporting armed men in military uniforms carrying out widespread looting, extortion and sexual violence, according to Radio Okapi, the station run by UN peacekeeping mission in DRC, MONUSCO.

Meanwhile, Stéphane Dujarric, the Secretary-General Spokesperson reported that other armed groups in the east, including Zaïre and the CODECO militias, have increased attacks against the population in Djugu territory in the past month, robbing civilians.

At least six people have been killed since last weekend and as a result, many have stopped using roads in the area, which also prevents them from going to their fields or to markets.

Reports indicate that some roads have reopened, but mass displacement continues, with at least 700,000 people now internally displaced within North Kivu and South Kivu.

Peacekeepers' response

Peacekeepers with (MONUSCO) have launched the second phase of an operation called Horizon of Peace in Djugu territory, aiming to contain an escalation of violence by armed groups, according to Mr. Dujarric.

MONUSCO peacekeepers have stepped up patrols on several roads in the territory to support the free movement of people and goods.

Calls for international action

Bruno Lemarquis, the UN's Humanitarian Coordinator for DR Congo, has issued a strong plea for immediate international support. "I call on the international community to step up its support in the face of a worsening humanitarian crisis," he stated.

Emergency food agency WFP has reiterated its readiness to resume food distributions as soon as security conditions permit, but without immediate access, thousands remain at risk of starvation and disease.

Title: DR Congo: 'Diplomacy has failed'

Despite the failure of all previous peace efforts in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, the international community, led by the mediator country Angola, remains committed to continuing negotiations.

The M23 rebels backed by Rwanda have expanded their control over the provincial capital of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo following their invasion on Monday.

After the early-morning incursion, chaotic conditions prevailed in the city of almost 2 million people. The United Nations said it was "deeply concerned," and humanitarian organizations have spoken of an immense need for aid.

"It's a predictable escalation given the failure of all previous peace initiatives," Jona Thiel of the German international relations and security policy think tank KFIBS told DW.

Hardened fronts

The region faces deeply rooted, primarily ethnically motivated tensions. According to Thiel, these conflicts cannot be resolved through negotiations in the short- or medium- term. He further explained that a negotiated peace deal would not automatically lead to pacification.

"One should not delude oneself into thinking that the conflict potential between the various militias would cease overnight with the signing of an agreement, if such an agreement ever materializes," he said

The main antagonists in the political conflict are Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi and Paul Kagame, Rwanda's president whose government in Kigali has increasingly supported the M23. Thiel says both failed to deviate from their maximalist positions.

"For Kigali, the M23 is a group that would represent Rwandan interests in any future negotiations. Kigali, therefore, wants to recognize the M23 as a negotiating partner. [The government in] Kinshasa, on the other hand, views the M23 as a terrorist group and refuses to recognize them as a legitimate negotiating partner."

A rapprochement between the two sides seems unlikely under these circumstances, agreed Jakob Kerstan, head of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation's office in Kinshasa, which is affiliated with Germany's conservative CDU party. Kerstan told DW that Tshisekedi has completely failed to ensure security in the east of the country.

"Félix Tshisekedi has replaced the army chief multiple times, changed the defense minister, hired Romanian mercenaries, brought in East African Community troops and then SADC (Southern African Development Community) forces, initiated military cooperation with Burundi and Uganda, and the UN mission Monusco is also still present," Kerstan said.

"And despite all this, he has been unable to maintain control over the heart of the region, the city of Goma." As a result, the president is increasingly under pressure.

All peace initiatives have failed

Mediations have repeatedly failed or led to only short-lived agreements. For instance, the government of DR Congo and the M23 signed a peace treaty in Nairobi, Kenya, and the group vanished from the scene. But at the end of 2021, it returned with new attacks.

In recent years, there have been two other major African peace initiatives: Former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta brought the conflicting parties together again in Nairobi in 2022 — but without the M23. This process failed.

Recently, the international community placed its hopes in Angola's mediation efforts. The "Luanda Roadmap," under President João Lourenço, was supported by the SADC, the African Union, the US and the European Union. However, the troubled negotiations eventually collapsed in December 2024 when Kagame canceled a last-minute meeting with Tshisekedi.

International support for Angola's peace process

The so-called "International Contact Group for the Great Lakes Region" politically — and indirectly financially — supported the Luanda process. Its members include representatives from Germany, Denmark, Belgium, the European Union, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the US and the UK.

This group has stated that the Luanda process must continue. It also demands that the M23 and Rwanda's armed forces cease their offensive, grant humanitarian workers access to Goma, and withdraw. Additionally, Western countries aim to assist in economically rebuilding the resource-rich area.

The goal is to transport the region's resources via new trade routes, such as the Lobito Corridor through DR Congo, Zambia and Angola, funded by Europe and the US. According to the International Contact Group's plan, the proceeds from the mineral trade should eventually foster prosperity and peace in the region.

What's next?

In February, Angola will take over the presidency of the African Union. President Lourenco and his Foreign Minister Tete Antonio have already announced plans to use this position to launch a new diplomatic offensive for peace in eastern DR Congo.

"Despite the failure of previous negotiations, there is no way forward without further peace efforts under Angola's mediation. This is about the security of the people, and of course also about resources and lucrative business opportunities," Nkikinamo Tussamba, an Angolan expert on eastern DR Congo, told DW.

Tussamba added that, naturally, Rwanda is also interested in the region's resources. "Rwanda wants peace in the region, but peace on its terms, a peace that considers its economic interests. That's why the Kagame regime has sabotaged the peace process driven by Angola with the support of the US."

According to Tussamba, a diplomatic solution through the Luanda process will have to be reached sooner or later.

Kerstan from the Konrad Adenauer Foundation shares a similar view. "Western countries, including Germany, insist the Luanda process must continue."

Now, with the M23 militias increasingly gaining military ground, the Congolese side will apply more pressure internationally, especially on the Western countries, to exert pressure on Rwanda.

Germany and Europe's Role

What can the German government do? "The German government could, for example, immediately stop development aid to Rwanda. This happened back in 2012 and 2013," Kerstan suggested.

"The [Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development] has only issued a rather weak statement so far, but it could also say: 'We are stopping development aid to Rwanda until the support for the M23 ends.'"

Kerstan added that the Rwandan state budget still largely depends on Western donors. "If Western countries unite and say they will no longer provide funding, it would impact Rwanda. [Germany] should adjust [its] view of the Rwandan government."

The prospects for genuine peace in the Great Lakes region are overall very poor. "As long as no trust base even remotely exists, there will be no pacification," Thiel, the KFIBS expert, said.

In a unanimous resolution, the Security Council condemned the M23 advances with the support of the Rwanda Defense Forces. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also called for a ceasefire in the region.

The United Nations Security Council on Friday urged the Rwandan military to withdraw its support for the M23 rebel group in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and pull out its soldiers from Congolese territory "without preconditions."

Large patches of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are now under the control of the M23 rebel group with the support of some 4,000 Rwandan soldiers, according to UN experts.

What did the Security Council resolution say?

On Friday, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution saying it "strongly condemns the ongoing offensive and advances of the M23 in North Kivu and South Kivu with the support of the Rwanda Defense Forces."

It also called on the Rwanda Defense Forces "to cease support to the M23 and immediately withdraw from DRC territory without preconditions."

Earlier, the Security Council had called for an "immediate and unconditional ceasefire" by all parties, but on Friday all countries including the three African members held Kigali responsible for the first time.

In a phone conversation with Kenya's President William Ruto on Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also called for an immediate ceasefire.

Rwanda, however, denies the allegations that it supports the M23 rebels with armed troops.

Expanding control of M23 rebels

Tensions of an escalating war loom as the M23 have captured the two largest cities in eastern Congo.

The M23 rebels have also gained control over Lake Kivu after its lightning offensive in the east.

The latest round of fights has forced more than 50,000 Congolese to move to Burundi, Uganda and other countries, according to the UN.

Since losing Bukavu to the rebels, the Congolese armed forces have barely put up a fight, instead retreating.

"Almost no Congolese soldiers are fighting," an observer said Friday, adding that the "only ones still fighting are the Wazalendo" pro-Kinshasa militia.

Congo accuses Rwanda of using M23 as a proxy to loot its natural resources. Meanwhile, Rwanda accuses Congo of supporting ethnic Hutu militias such as the FDLR, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda.

The Ugandan troop deployment comes as the Congolese army faces a major challenge from rebel groups seeking to control the mineral-rich region.

Uganda's army said on Tuesday that its troops would be deploying to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to help fight local militias.

The troops will be deploying to the town of Bunia in the eastern part of the DRC.

Why is the Ugandan military deploying in Congo?

Uganda's military accused militia groups of committing "massacres" in eastern Congo.

"There were massacres being committed by some militia groups and we agreed with our Congolese counterparts to carry out joint operations to save lives," Ugandan military spokesman Felix Kulayigye told AFP.

Uganda already had thousands of troops in the DRC's Ituri province, of which Bunia is the capital.

Ugandan troops had been there working alongside DRC forces against an Islamist group, the Allied Democratic Forces, which has been linked to the "Islamic State" group.

The head of Uganda's armed forces, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, gave rebel groups an ultimatum on Saturday.

"I'm giving exactly 24 hours for all forces in Bunia to surrender their arms! If they don't we shall consider them enemies and attack them," Kainerugaba posted on the platform X.

Also on Tuesday, the Reuters news agency cited various military and diplomatic sources as saying that Burundi was withdrawing its forces from eastern Congo, where they had been adding Congolese troops in the fight against M23.

Where are rebels advancing in Congo?

The deployment of Ugandan troops to eastern DRC comes as the Congolese army faces a major challenge from the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group.

M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups currently vying for control of the eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region, critical for global technology, worth trillions of dollars in wealth.

On Tuesday, M23 appeared to be heading toward the eastern Congolese city of Butembo, a little over two weeks after they captured the regional hub of Goma.

The rebels have also seized another provincial capital to Goma's south, Bukavu, near Burundi.

UN rights chief accuses M23 of rights abuses

On Tuesday, the UN human rights chief Volker Turk accused the Rwanda-backed rebels of killing children and attacking hospitals and warehouses storing humanitarian aid.

In a statement, Turk said that his office "confirmed cases of summary execution of children by M23 after they entered the city of Bukavu last week. We are also aware that children were in possession of weapons."

UN agencies have previously accused both the rebels and Congolese government forces of recruiting children.

Reuters —

Some 7,000 people have died since January in fighting in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), its prime minister told a high-level meeting of the Human Rights Council in Geneva on Monday.

Some 450,000 people are without shelter after 90 displacement camps were destroyed, Judith Suminwa Tuluka added.

The M23’s advance is the gravest escalation in more than a decade of the long-running conflict in eastern Congo. The rebel group’s capture of swathes of the east and valuable mineral deposits has fanned fears of a wider war.

Rwanda rejects allegations from Congo, the United Nations and Western powers that it supports M23 with arms and troops.

The prime minister urged the world to act and to impose “dissuasive sanctions” amid mass displacements and summary executions.

“It is impossible to describe the screams and cries of millions of victims of this conflict,” she added.

In the opening remarks at the 58th UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, UN chief Antonio Guterres said that human rights around the world are being “suffocated” and referred to horrifying human rights abuses in the DRC.

Since the start of the year, the DRC has faced back-to-back losses in North and South Kivu provinces, fueling criticism of the authorities’ military strategy.

A boat carrying people fleeing the ongoing rebel advance in eastern Congo has capsized, killing 22 people, authorities said Thursday.

The boat was carrying people from Vitshumbi on the southern shore of Lake Edward towards Virunga National Park on the northern side of the lake when it capsized late Wednesday, said Delphin Malekani, the president of the local civil society in Kyavinonge.

The majority of victims were people fleeing the ongoing advance of Rwanda-backed M23 rebels. Authorities didn't immediately say what caused the boat to capsize. There were eight survivors, officials said.

M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo’s mineral wealth. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighbouring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometres) away.

This week, the rebels seized another provincial capital in Goma’s south, Bukavu, near Burundi. The region is rich in gold and coltan, a key mineral for the production of capacitors used in most consumer electronics such as laptops and smartphones.

Analysts have said the rebels are eyeing political power, unlike their brief capture of Goma, a major security and humanitarian hub, in 2012.

The rebel-appointed mayor of Goma said Tuesday they would carry out a census, in a sign of their intention to maintain control of the city. And ferry service resumed between Goma and Bukavu, the only way to travel between the two locations for now.

Situated on the border with Uganda, ferry service has been banned on Lake Edward since March of last year, but as people flee the rapid M23 advance, some have turned to unreliable and dangerous illegal ferry services. Hundreds have already been killed or declared missing in capsizings so far this year.

The capsizing of overloaded boats is also becoming increasingly frequent in the central African nation as more people are choosing to travel in unsafe wooden vessels instead of by road because of security reasons.

The roads are often caught up in the deadly clashes between Congolese security forces and rebels that sometimes block major access routes.

In Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo, more than 200 police officers and soldiers have defected to the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC/M23), a rebel movement active in the country's east. The defection ceremony took place in front of the provincial police headquarters, drawing the attention of the local population.

Defections Driven by Lack of Resources

Jackson Nkamba, Senior Commissioner of the Congolese National Police (PNC), justified the move by highlighting the poor working conditions of security forces.

"We were trained with the Congolese government's money, and I am Congolese. If the government provided the necessary resources, the police would be professional. We are being retrained to become a new kind of police force—one that doesn’t have to intervene on foot or go into the field without even having a meal," he said.

The defectors will undergo further training in Rumangabo, North Kivu, under the AFC/M23’s supervision. The movement claims it aims to establish a more disciplined and effective police force in the areas under its control.

M23’s Security Agenda

General Bernard Byamungu, head of operations for the Revolutionary Army of Congo, emphasized the movement’s commitment to restoring security by disarming civilians.

"All these weapons must be taken away from the population so they can live in peace. We will work together to ensure security," he stated.

Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23’s spokesperson, framed the defections as a step towards a broader political vision.

"The police officers joining us want to work with us to liberate the country and fight against tribalism, exclusion, and poor governance," he explained.

A Worsening Security Situation

As the M23 expands its control, the Congolese army (FARDC) is urging deserters to return to their units. Meanwhile, fighting continues on the ground. In Lubero, clashes between the FARDC and M23 have led to widespread looting, further worsening the region’s security crisis.

The mass defection of police and military personnel to the M23 underscores the deep divisions weakening the DRC’s east, where ongoing power struggles between armed groups and the central government continue to fuel instability.

The former head of state believes that Félix Tshisekedi aims to become the "absolute ruler of the country" by silencing the opposition and resorting to "intimidation, arbitrary arrests, and extrajudicial executions."

Former leader of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Joseph Kabila, stated on Sunday that the poor governance of his successor, President Felix Tshisekedi, has significantly contributed to the escalating conflict in the eastern region of the country.

In an opinion piece published in South Africa's Sunday Times, Kabila argued that the unrest cannot be attributed solely to the advances of the Rwanda-supported M23 armed group or the tensions between Kinshasa and Kigali.

M23 fighters have rapidly gained control over large areas of the resource-rich eastern DRC in recent weeks, raising concerns that the conflict may extend beyond the country's borders.

Kabila noted that since Tshisekedi assumed office in 2019 following his election victory, the situation in the DRC has worsened to a point where it is "close to imploding."

He described the December 2023 elections, which resulted in a landslide victory for Tshisekedi's second term, as a "sham," accusing the government of suppressing political opposition and allowing the president to become the "absolute master of the country."

Kabila highlighted issues such as intimidation, arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial killings, and the forced exile of politicians, journalists, and church leaders as key features of Tshisekedi's rule.

He warned that the numerous violations of the constitution and human rights, along with the repeated massacres of the Congolese people by Tshisekedi’s security forces, will persist even if negotiations between the DRC and Rwanda succeed or if M23 is militarily defeated.

Kabila cautioned that neglecting these underlying issues while focusing solely on the M23 would result in ongoing political instability, armed conflict, and potentially civil war.

Any effort to resolve this crisis that overlooks its fundamental causes—primarily the governance of the DRC by its current leaders—will fail to achieve lasting peace.

The M23, claiming to defend the rights of the DRC's minority Tutsi population, renewed its military actions in 2021, two years after Tshisekedi assumed power.

South Africa has deployed over 1,000 troops to the DRC as part of a mission by the 16-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) to assist the government and stabilize the area.

Last month, fourteen South African soldiers lost their lives in the conflict.

The DR Congo insists on a military solution in the fight against the Rwandan-backed M23 rebels. Analysts say the fall of Bukavu could complicate matters.

In the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the fighting between the rebel coalition led by the M23 and the Congolese army continues unabated. The militias are gaining more and more territory in the South Kivu province and captured the provincial capital of Bukavu on Sunday.

According to the Reuters news agency, the rebels saw little resistance from government forces against the unprecedented expansion of territory they controlled after years of fighting.

One Bakavu resident described the situation to DW as chaos, with looting at markets and stores. The resident lived near a military camp of the Congolese arm. He said on Saturday afternoon, fleeing soldiers set fire to their ammunition depot.

"A projectile even landed in my house and destroyed my property and equipment, the windows were broken."

On Friday, the militias announced they had taken control of the strategically important Bukavu airport, located 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of the city of Kavumu. Independent observers confirmed the M23's account.

Growing danger of a regional war

According to Ciaran Wrons-Passmann, Managing Director of the Ecumenical Network Central Africa in Berlin, the capture of Bukavu airport was significant.

"This would cut off the entire east from the rest of the Democratic Republic of Congo and make it more difficult to supply the Congolese army with military equipment and troops," Wrons-Passmann told DW. He said that the Congolese army leadership must now adapt to these circumstances.



Since the M23 rebels captured the border town of Goma, horrifying details of mass murders and mass rapes have emerged. According to the Congolese government, 3,000 people have been killed and around 700,000 displaced since the offensive began as the heavily armed militia rapidly advanced into the area.



The growing crisis prompted the East African Community (EAC), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) to call for an immediate ceasefire — so far without sustained success.

"It appears that the countries in the region are exerting great pressure on to withdraw," Abiol Lual Deng, a South Sudanese-American political scientist, said.

"But the region has long been at war," she added, referring to the Geneva Convention and the rules of international law enshrined therein, which have been violated for years and have led to a humanitarian catastrophe.



Deng believes it is possible that "concessions will be made to the M23 to satisfy part of Rwanda's demand for minerals from the eastern Congo." Rwanda is the world's largest exporter of coltan, which is crucial to the nation's economy.



The Congolese authorities see the M23 rebels as a proxy army of Rwanda that supports the illegal exploitation of huge mineral resources in eastern Congo, which are estimated to be worth several trillion euros.

Rwanda admits troop deployment in Congo

Until now, Rwanda's President Paul Kagame has rejected accusations by the DR Congo, the United Nations and Burundi that Rwandan troops were involved in the fighting. However, in an interview with the French magazine Jeune Afrique, he officially acknowledged the presence of his troops in the DR Congo.



"We don't have much time to put an end to this dynamic," Stephanie Wolters, an analyst at the South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA), told DW, referring to the territorial gains made by the M23 in South Kivu.



Wolters calls for faster intervention and more consistent pressure on Rwanda, including from the international community. Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi must also be urged to negotiate. He has so far refused to do so. She emphasizes only a dialogue between DR Congo and Rwanda could overcome the acute crisis phase and perhaps prevent a major war.

This weekend, at the Munich Security Conference, Tshisekedi pointed fingers at Kagame, claiming he has attacked the DRC and violated its territorial integrity.

"We are determined to restore the integrity of our land, and we are getting there," Tshisekedi said to DW. Now, it is up to the international community "to do everything possible to prevent the conflict from spreading to the region," the president said.

However, Rwanda's Defence Minister, Juvenal Marizamunda, denies any interest in fighting against the DRC at the Munich conference.

"Rwanda has nothing to gain from an unstable DRC. On the contrary, our vision for prosperity is tied to regional stability and economic cooperation," he told DW. "The crisis in eastern DRC is a challenge for all of us in the region. Rwanda has been heavily affected with devastating human, political and economic consequences."

Burundi threatens Rwanda with war

The advance of the M23 is fueling fears of a regional war. Analyst Wrons-Passmann also sees Tshisekedi's decision to continue to rely on military action as worrying and fears a broader conflict.

An M23 attack on Bukavu near the Burundian border would mean heavy fighting with Burundian forces and possibly a direct war with Rwanda, he said.

Burundi plays a major role in the conflict. According to Wrons-Passmann, this not only has to do with the country's security interests, but Burundi is in a severe economic crisis and lacks foreign currency.

"It is, therefore, convenient that Congo is paying well for the deployment of Burundian troops."

A year ago, Burundi angrily closed its borders with Rwanda and broke off diplomatic relations, accusing its neighbor of supporting rebels in eastern Congo who were agitating against Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye.

Burundian troops were sent to fight alongside Congolese soldiers, and Burundi has reinforced its presence since the conflict escalated at the end of January.

Ndayishimiye, who came to power in 2020, is very outspoken. He has accused Rwanda's Kagame of ruthless warmongering.

"If Rwanda continues to conquer the territory of another country, I know for a fact that it will even reach Burundi," Ndayishimiye said in January at a diplomatic meeting in Bujumbura, Burndi's capital. He warned that the war would take on "a regional dimension."

Such threats have raised fears that Burundi could also be further involved in the escalation in the run-up to the June parliamentary elections.

Some M23 fighters with Rwandan troops on Sunday entered the centre of another key city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as the African Union highlighted growing fears that the strife-torn country could break up.

The armed group reached the outlying districts of Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province, on Friday, shortly after taking control of its airport about thirty kilometres (18 miles) away.

The fall of the city of one million people, which was barely defended by the Congolese armed forces (FARDC), gives the M23 total control of Lake Kivu, following its capture of Goma, the capital of the neighbouring province of North Kivu, at the end of January.

SPONSOR AD

Growing international calls have been made for Rwanda to end its military backing for M23. It denies that its troops are in DRC.

With fears that the offensive could ignite a regional war, the international community has multiplied calls for a de-escalation and ceasefire, so far in vain.

“We don’t want a balkanisation of eastern DRC,” the African Union’s Peace and Security Commissioner Bankole Adeoye told reporters at a summit in Addis Ababa.

Without mentioning Rwanda, he added: “We are calling for the immediate removal of M23 and their supporters from all towns and cities including Goma airport.”

UN chief Antonio Guterres, speaking Saturday at the opening of the AU summit, demanded that the DRC’s “territorial integrity” be respected and a regional war avoided.

The French foreign ministry called for an immediate withdrawal of Rwandan troops, while Britain on Sunday warned that the Rwandan-backed offensive risked sparking “a wider regional conflict”.

The DRC claims that some 4,000 Rwandan soldiers are in the east of the country.

The conflict with M23 has lasted more than three years, with Kinshasa accusing Kigali of wanting to control the mining and trade of minerals used in batteries and electronic equipment, and also of trying to appropriate land for agriculture.

Rwanda denies the charges and says its security is threatened by armed groups in the region, notably the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), created by former Hutu leaders linked to the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda.

The world is witnessing a new era of conflict. In Gaza, images of devastation have dominated headlines for more than a year. In Ukraine, nations have rallied to defend sovereignty against aggression, deploying diplomatic interventions, sending military aid and enacting sweeping sanctions with urgency. Yet the war unfolding in the Democratic Republic of Congo remains an afterthought. A bloody conflict is met with condemnations but no meaningful action. This stark contrast is not just neglect; it is selective justice.

Last month Goma, the largest city in the east of Congo, fell to the M23 rebel group, backed by neighboring Rwanda, as part of the group’s decade-long campaign to control the region’s mineral-rich territory. The assault on Goma resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths in the first week alone and thousands of injuries. Today hospitals in Goma are overwhelmed, with many patients being treated in makeshift tents to handle the overflow. The blood supply is strained, the cost of food is skyrocketing, and access to water, electricity and the internet is severely limited. The U.N. uncovered that in the chaos, more than 100 female inmates at a prison were raped and then burned alive when the facility caught fire.

Congo has been plagued by war for nearly three decades. Millions of people have been displaced, and rape has consistently been used as a weapon of war. Most estimates state that over six million people have died, making it the deadliest conflict since World War II. But many of us who live in Congo believe that the real number is much higher. And the world remains largely silent.

I am a Congolese doctor. For 30 years, I have repaired the bodies of women brutalized by this war. Today I’m treating the grandchildren of my early patients. At Panzi Hospital and Foundation, the health center and nongovernmental organization I founded in 1999, we have treated over 83,000 survivors of sexual violence. Thousands have arrived pregnant by their attackers. Thirty percent of the sexual violence survivors we see are children. The patterns of terror are unmistakable: villages burned, families slaughtered, women violated — not as collateral damage but as a calculated weapon of war, designed to instill fear, erase communities and seize control.

Rebel advance causes panic in Congolese border town Uvira

Audio By Carbonatix

(Reuters) -Volleys of gunfire rang out in Democratic Republic of Congo’s eastern border town of Uvira on Wednesday, local sources said, as clashes broke out among allied forces amid the advance of Rwanda-backed rebels.

Residents and officials described scenes of looting, bodies lying in the street, and government soldiers commandeering boats to flee across Lake Tanganyika. The local prison was also emptied, they said.

The M23 rebels have been moving south towards Uvira, which shares a lake border with Burundi, since they seized the provincial capital Bukavu over the weekend – the heaviest loss for Congo since the fall of the region’s largest city Goma in late January.

The militants’ reported entry into the town of Kamanyola on Tuesday has caused panic in Uvira, 80 km (50 miles) to the south. Since Bukavu’s fall, retreating Congolese troops have ended up fighting allied militia called the Wazalendo who do not want to withdraw.

“We woke up to bullets flying because of the advance of the rebels, who are still a long way off,” a local official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

“The forces we were counting on, the FARDC (army) and the Wazalendo, are at odds. There are deaths and looting.”

Four Uvira residents also said they heard volleys of gunfire in the city. A humanitarian source said there were bodies lying in the streets, around 30 bodies in the town’s morgue, and more than 100 people hospitalised with serious injuries as a result of the violence. Reuters could not independently confirm these figures.

Medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said clashes and armed looting in Uvira were blocking ambulances and had forced the charity to reduce its staff in the town.

Over 500 Congolese police officers fled across the border to Burundi, where they were disarmed, a security source, a diplomatic source and a local official said. The interior ministers of Burundi and Congo did not respond to requests for comment.

The chaos underscores the Congolese authorities’ weakening control in the east, where M23’s unprecedented territorial gains and capture of valuable mining areas have stoked fears of a wider war.

Many soldiers were piling onto boats to escape Uvira, one security source said, adding this was “creating unrest among people who can’t get on”, with “shooting in all directions”.

“The rapid and uninterrupted expansion of the conflict, particularly in South Kivu province, continues to inflict a heavy toll on the civilian population,” top U.N. aid official in Congo, Bruno Lemarquis, said in a statement.

PRISONERS FREED

The prison in Uvira was cleared of inmates, including 228 soldiers who had been arrested for deserting, the security source said. It was not clear if the detainees forced their way out of the prison or had been released.

Hopes of Congo mustering a defence against the M23’s advance have flagged with the recent withdrawal of allied Burundian troops, sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Burundi has denied such a pull-back.

Congo has asked Chad for military support to help fight the M23, a Chadian official and a source at the Congolese presidency said. Last week, Chad’s Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Sabre Fadoul told Reuters that the idea of Chad sending military support to Congo was “pure speculation”.

Meanwhile, fighting between rebels and the Congolese army has also flared in neighbouring North Kivu province, an army spokesperson, Mak Hazukay, said on Wednesday, adding that some soldiers had abandoned their positions in the area, creating panic.

The well-equipped M23 is the latest in a long line of ethnic Tutsi-led rebel movements to emerge in Congo’s volatile east, renewing a conflict over power, ethnic rivalry and mineral resources dating back to the 1990s genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.

Rwanda denies allegations from Congo and the United Nations that it supports the group with arms and troops. It says it is defending itself against a Hutu militia, which it says is fighting alongside the Congolese military.

Congo rejects Rwanda’s complaints and says Rwanda has used its proxy militias to loot its minerals such as coltan, used in smartphones and computers.

The disorder in the east has fuelled a sense of worry and panic 1,600 km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa, where some residents are looking to move their families abroad amid open talk of a coup.

Top United Nations officials in Africa warned an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that the offensive of Rwanda-backed rebels in mineral-rich eastern Congo is threatening peace in the wider region.

“It is imperative that this council takes urgent and decisive steps to avert a wider regional war," said Bintou Keita, U.N. special envoy for Congo.

The seizure of major cities in eastern Congo by the M23 rebel group in recent weeks and statements by key parties show that “the risk of a regional conflagration is more real today than ever before,” said Huang Xia, U.N. special envoy for Africa's Great Lakes region, which includes Congo, Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda.

France’s U.N. Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere urged the council to quickly adopt a draft resolution circulated by his country two weeks ago that reaffirms support for Congo’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, urges an end to the M23 offensive and the withdrawal of Rwandan troops, and calls for the urgent resumption of talks.

“The risk of a regional war is increasing each day,” he said.

The M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo’s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth. The region is rich in gold and coltan, a key mineral used in consumer electronics like laptops and smartphones.

The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, over 1,000 miles away.

In a lightning three-week offensive, the M23 took control of eastern Congo's main city of Goma and seized the second largest city, Bukavu, on Sunday.

Keita, who also heads the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, told the Security Council that since then, the M23 has kept advancing, seizing the town of Kamanyola at the intersection of three borders — Congo, Rwanda and Burundi.

Congo’s Foreign Minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner demanded the Security Council to order the immediate withdrawal of Rwandan troops.

“These forces have trampled on international law, brought death and devastation and violated our sovereignty,” she said.

Rwanda’s U.N. Ambassador Ernest Rwamucyo said “African leadership must drive the resolution of this conflict,” criticizing Congo’s president for seeking sanctions against his country from Western governments.

At this stage, the U.N. doesn’t know the M23 agenda, the intention of its backers or how far they will go and why, said Huang, the Great Lakes U.N. envoy.

“This situation must stop before we see the triggering of a widespread regional war, the consequences of which would be devastating” and undermine efforts over the past decade to bring stability to the central Africa region, Huang said.

The U.N. Human Rights Council this month launched a commission to investigate atrocities, including allegations of rapes and killings akin to “summary executions” by both sides.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi announced he is going to reach out to opposition leaders in a bid to create a unity government, as a humanitarian crisis deepens in the country's east with the advance of M23 rebels.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi said he is going to begin discussions to form a unity government, as international pressure mounts for the Congolese government to resolve the crisis in the country's east.

M23 rebels, supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to UN experts, have been leading an insurgency in the central African country since last month.

The rebels captured the eastern city of Goma, a city of 2 million people, last month, as about 3,000 people were killed. The rebels seized another provincial capital to Goma's south, Bukavu, a city of more than a million people, earlier this week.

Bukavu sits roughly 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Burundi, whose troops have been fighting alongside the Congolese Army. Fighting between the Congolese army and M23 rebels has fanned fears of a wider regional war.

Tshisekedi says he will reach out to opposition

In some of his first statements since rebels captured the major cities, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi told a meeting of the ruling Sacred Union coalition to not be distracted by internal quarrels.

"I lost the battle and not the war. I must reach out to everyone including the opposition. There will be a government of national unity," said Tshisekedi.

He didn't give more details on what that would entail or when it would happen.

Regional leaders have urged talks between M23 and the Congolese government. But Tshisekedi has previously ruled out such dialogue, saying the rebels were a Rwandan proxy army.

UN Security Council urges Rwanda to stop supporting M23 rebels

The UN Security Council passed a unanimous resolution Friday demanding that the "M23 immediately cease hostilities, withdraw from all areas that it controls" and "fully reverse the establishment of illegitimate parallel administrations in the DRC territory."

"There is no military solution to the conflict in the east of the DRC," he said. "The offensive carried out by the M23 supported by Rwanda must be put to an end."

M23 rebels say it's fighting to protect Tutsis and Congolese of Rwanda origin from discrimination and fighting against an ethnic Hutu militia group with links to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

Congo accuses the rebels of expanding their foothold in Congo's mineral-rich region and analysts have called those pretext for Rwanda's involvement.

Congo army runaways loot and sow panic in North Kivu town

Audio By Carbonatix

(Reuters) – The Congolese army called on deserters to rejoin their units on Thursday, as rogue soldiers fired guns and looted parts of the eastern town of Lubero after fleeing nearby clashes with advancing Rwandan-backed rebels.

The unrest points to mounting disarray within the Congolese armed forces in the face of the M23 rebel group’s ongoing offensive, which has captured eastern Democratic Republic of Congo’s two largest cities and stoked fears of a wider war.

A statement from a military spokesperson for operations in North Kivu province ordered runaway soldiers around Lubero to return to their posts within 12 hours and called on all soldiers to refrain from theft and other illegal acts.

Fighting with the M23 has continued outside the town, in the southern part of the wider Lubero territory, for the past 72 hours, Congolese army spokesperson Sylvain Ekenge told Reuters.

On Thursday morning, five residents of Lubero town described chaotic scenes linked to the desertions from the front line, including bursts of gunfire and looting at the central market and in shops selling mobile phones and clothes.

“It’s complete turmoil in Lubero. Shots can be heard … The soldiers are running in all directions,” said one of the residents, speaking on condition of anonymity out of security concerns.

Later, Lubero’s military administrator Alain Kiwewa said order had been restored in the town and blamed a group of undisciplined soldiers for sowing panic.

RETREAT FROM BUKAVU

Such incidents and a flare-up of fighting with the M23 around Lubero have added to pressure on the army. It staged a disorderly retreat in neighbouring South Kivu province after the M23 advance into the provincial capital Bukavu over the weekend led to clashes between Congolese forces and allied militias, which wanted to stay and fight.

The escalation has alarmed the wider region and the international community. On Thursday, the United States imposed sanctions on a Rwandan government minister and a senior rebel for their alleged role in the conflict.

Neighbouring Rwanda denies allegations from Congo and the United Nations that it supports the M23 with arms and troops. It says it is defending itself against Hutu militias which it accuses of fighting alongside the Congolese military.

Congo rejects this and says Rwanda has used the M23 as a proxy to loot its minerals such as gold and coltan, used in smartphones and computers.

Congo’s finance ministry on Thursday announced the launch of a solidarity fund for the army that allows citizens, companies and organisations to donate directly to the eastern war effort.

The initiative highlights the financial toll of the three-year insurgency which has seen the M23 capture unprecedented swathes of Congolese territory and valuable mining areas, renewing a conflict over power, ethnic rivalry and resources that dates back to the 1990s genocide in Rwanda.

Rwanda-backed rebels tightened their grip on Bukavu on Monday, a day after seizing the second major city in eastern Congo whose residents appeared resigned to their fate under the new rulers.

On Sunday, M23 rebels captured the city of 1.3 million people after it was abandoned by Congolese forces. Bukavu lies 63 miles (101 kilometers) south of Goma, which was taken by the rebels in late January.

The M23 is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of eastern Congo’s trillions of dollars in mineral wealth that’s critical for much of the world’s technology. The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts.

The decades-long fighting has displaced more than 6 million people in the region, creating the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.

As the rebels made their way into Bukavu, its streets were flooded by residents attempting to leave and looters filling flour sacks with what they could find. A pall of silence set in later as residents and business owners braced for M23's entrance into the city center.

On Monday morning, people gradually started coming out again while the rebels patrolled major intersections in the city.

“People are still scared to go out because of the insecurity so it's not business as usual yet,” David Balezi, a shopkeeper in Bukavu, told The Associated Press.

Bukavu's border crossing to Rwanda was closed on Monday morning, as were most shops and stores while traffic gradually picked up again.

“Now we thank God that the situation is OK, even if we don’t know what’s coming. Whatever happens, we will live with it,” David Munyaga, a resident of Bukavu, said.

On Monday, Erasto Bahati Musanga, the rebel-appointed governor of North-Kivu province announced that Goma and Bukavu’s ports will reopen Tuesday. Navigation on Lake Kivu, one of the largest lakes in Africa, had been banned since late January, during the rebels offensive on Goma.

In rebel-controlled Goma, hundreds of protesters gathered to call for the departure of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Congo, known as MONUSCO, and the withdrawal of troops from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which includes countries ranging from Congo to South Africa.

The protestors organized a sit-in in front of the MONUSCO headquarters in Goma, with some brandishing signs and chanting slogans calling for the resignation of Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi.

“The war does not end in Congo, why? They have nothing to do here, they should leave," Bauma Sukali, a protester, said.

Another protester, Fiston Nsabimana, said: “Tshisekedi is not able to ensure peace, let him leave power.”

The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo

29 January 2025 Ian Wafula Africa security correspondent, BBC News

Protesters in Kinshasa, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo, have been burning portraits of Rwanda's president and tearing up Rwandan flags as M23 rebels have taken control of most the eastern city of Goma. Their fury is focused on Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who they accuse of backing the rebels - an accusation long made by the UN. To put it bluntly, a group of UN experts maintains the Rwandan army is in "de facto control of M23 operations", detailing how M23 recruits are trained under Rwandan supervision and supported by high-tech Rwandan weaponry. Goma, which lies at the foot of a volcano near Lake Kivu, sits on the border with Rwanda. It is the capital of mineral-rich North Kivu province - and is an important trading and humanitarian hub and the base for the UN's largest peacekeeping mission. The city had also become a refuge for those fleeing the conflict between M23 fighters and the army that erupted again in late 2021 - with the population swelling to around two million. They all face further turmoil as fighting erupted there on Sunday night with loud explosions echoing through the streets, which are now strewn with bodies. The exact circumstances of what is going on is unclear as phone lines are down and electricity and water supplies have been cut off. But the M23 seem to have captured most, if not all, of the city. "There was no question that there are Rwandan troops in Goma supporting the M23," said UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix, though he added that it was it was difficult to tell the exact numbers on the ground in Goma.

AFP The M23 says it is a Congolese rebel group defending DR Congo's Tutsi community

Tellingly some Congolese army soldiers in Goma who surrendered on Monday, did so by crossing over the border into Rwanda. Since the conflict begun, President Kagame has repeatedly denied any involvement in supporting the M23 rebels, who are well equipped, well armed and well trained. However, this response has noticeably shifted as accusations continue to grow with "overwhelming evidence" showing Rwanda's support for the rebel group, according to Richard Moncrief, International Crisis Group's project director for the Great Lakes. "The tone has changed to justification for defensive measures," he told the BBC. "It has become harder to deny Rwanda's support for M23." On Sunday, Rwanda's foreign ministry said in a statement: "This fighting close to the Rwandan border continues to present a serious threat to Rwanda's security and territorial integrity, and necessitates Rwanda's sustained defensive posture." It said it was concerned by "misguided or manipulative" statements that lacked context about the conflict. For Kagame, the context all comes down to the Rwandan genocide that took place over 100 days in 1994. The ethnic Hutu militia involved in killing up to 800,000 people - the vast majority from the Tutsi community - fled to what is now DR Congo, some forming the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR). This rebel group is still active in the notoriously unstable eastern DR Congo - and still includes some of those responsible for the genocide. Kagame, who headed the rebel Tutsi force that ended the killing more than three decades ago, sees this "genocidal militia" as an existential threat.

AFP This month alone 400,000 people have fled their homes because of the fighting

His government has twice invaded DR Congo, saying it wants to stop Hutu rebel groups from staging cross-border attacks. Earlier this month he called out his Congolese counterpart, Félix Tshisekedi, for failing to deal with the FDLR and talk to the M23, saying this was exacerbating the conflict. Mr Moncrief believes that the targeting of Goma is more about making a political point as he says the M23 does not need the city strategically as it already "controls many more lucrative areas". "It is President Kagame's way of exerting power over who is in charge of North Kivu," said the Great Lakes expert. Rwanda accused the military governor of North Kivu, who was killed in fighting last week, of collaborating with the FDLR. The discovery of this kind of high-level collaboration, experts agree, would have been like a red rag to a bull for Rwanda.

Reuters Rwandan soldiers escorted surrendering Congolese troops over the border into Rwanda on Monday

The M23's origins are tied to these tensions - it is the latest incarnation of a rebel group that says it is fighting for the interests of the minority Tutsi community in eastern DR Congo. Its first uprising more than a decade ago ended with a peace deal - when its fighters disarmed and mainly moved into camps in Uganda. But three years ago, they began leaving the camps saying the deal was not honoured and within a couple months were seizing territory. The UN peacekeeping mission - first deployed in 1999 - is not mandated to go on the offensive. Two regional forces - an East African one followed by a southern African one - specially deployed over the last few years at the request of Tshisekedi have failed to contain the M23. This gives an indication of the M23's sophisticated operations. According to the UN group of experts, this includes five months of training at the M23's main base in Tchanzu, hilly terrain not far from Rwanda's border, that incorporates courses on theory and ideology and then practical elements including "war tactics", "engagement rules'' and "bush tactics". It said Rwandan officers were often at the camp, where recruits, including children, were brought - some joining up on a voluntary basis, others forced to do so in a systematic operation where local chiefs had to provide conscripts. The experts said Sultani Makenga, who once fought for Kagame in the early 1990s in Rwanda and is now the M23's military chief, attended some of the passing-out ceremonies between 25 September and 31 October 2024 that involved 3,000 recruits. Rwanda's spokesperson Yolande Makolo did not address the question of whether Rwandan officers were in the M23 camp but she did deny the charges about child soldiers, telling the BBC last year: "The claim about recruiting minors in camps is absurd, it's blatant information warfare against Rwanda." However UN expert reports detail how the M23's strength has grown since May when numbers were put at around 3,000. The experts estimate that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan army troops are on the ground in DR Congo - saying it based this on authenticated photographs, drone footage, video recordings, testimonies and intelligence. Captured M23 fighters said that the Rwandans were known as the "Friendly Force", with the experts' December report saying the English term was "generically used" even when interviewees were speaking in other languages.

UN UN experts included photos of a short-range air defence system in their most recent report, saying three were spotted in M23 territory (Kibumba, Kitchanga and Karuba) in November being operated by soldiers using weaponry and backpacks similar to standard Rwandan army issue

They said these Rwandan special forces were there to train and support the rebels, and they did not interact with M23 regulars. Rwanda's ally Uganda, unhappy about another rebel group in DR Congo that threatens its security, has also been accused of helping the M23 - with its officers also spotted at Tchanzu. The UN experts say Uganda has also supplied weapons, hosted rebel leaders and allowed cross-border movements of M23 fighters - accusations Kampala denies. Kagame recently expressed his frustration that after Tshisekedi came to power in 2019, his suggestion that Rwanda work alongside the Congolese army to tackle the FDLR had been rebuffed - unlike a joint offensive by DR Congo and Uganda against the Islamist Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels. This may explain the re-emergence of the M23 in 2021 - with evidence showing Rwanda's backing of the group continues to grow. Clémentine de Montjoye, senior researcher in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that geolocated images placed Rwandan troops in Sake, a town just outside Goma last week. The UN experts say the M23's decision to capture the mining town of Rubaya, which fell to its forces in May, was "motivated by a strategic need to monopolise" the lucrative trade in coltan, which is used to make mobile phones and other electronic items such as cameras and inside cars. Its December report says the group now collects at least $800,000 (£643,000) a month from the taxation of coltan in Rubaya - and ensures that around 120 tonnes of the coveted mineral is sent directly to Rwanda every four weeks. It includes satellite images to show how a road was widened by September on the Congolese side of the Kibumba border crossing to allow access for heavy trucks that were previously unable to use the route into Rwanda.

Ms De Montjoye explained how the advanced weapons being used by the M23 were not available to any other of the numerous armed groups operating in eastern DR Congo. "Earlier last year, we documented how Rwandan forces, and M23 had fired 122mm rockets, hitting displacement camps," she told the BBC. "It's certainly with the kind of military support that the M23 has received that they've been able to make such an advance [on Goma]."

The UN experts have documented many such examples, including the use of Israeli-made anti-tank guided missiles. Mr Moncrief said the M23 was also using technology to interfere with Global Positioning System (GPS) that had stopped the Congolese army from flying drones it had acquired from China. The UN experts said the "spoofing and jamming" near areas controlled by M23 and the Rwandan army had also disrupted other aircraft. President Kagame has dismissed these UN reports, pouring scorn on their "expertise" and saying they ignore many outrages committed in DR Congo to focus on "imaginary problems" created by the M23. The East African Community – currently headed by Kenya's president - is now trying to mediate, though Tshisekedi has said he will not attend a hastily organised emergency summit. Observers say Rwanda's president will be telling any mediator that the FDLR is the only subject up for discussion as he is adamant their presence makes DR Congo an unsafe neighbour - something he reiterated at a press conference earlier this month. "Honestly, for the last 30 years if anyone wanted to understand what the problems are [in DR Congo] and what solutions should be, you don't even need to be an expert," Kagame said.

Speaking at the African Union summit (AU) on Saturday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that a regional escalation of the conflict in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) must be avoided at all costs.

The AU’s 55 members are meeting as the Rwanda-backed M23 fighters continue there advance in the eastern DRC, on Friday claiming to have entered the region’s second largest city, Bukavu.

“The fighting that is raging in South Kivu, as a result of the continuation of the M23 offensive, threatens to push the entire region over the precipice,” Guterres told leaders at the summit.

"There is no military solution. The deadlock must end, the dialogue must begin, and the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC must be respected," he said.

In recent weeks, M23 rebels have captured swathes of the DRC’s mineral-rich eastern region, including the key city of Goma, capital of North Kivu province.

With international pressure mounting on Rwanda to curb the fighting in eastern DRC, the conflict was set to dominate the summit at AU headquarters in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.

DRC’s President Félix Tshisekedi continues to plead with the international community to intervene to contain the rebels and blacklist Rwanda for backing them.

He did not attend the gathering, but Rwanda's President Paul Kagame was seen attending meetings at the summit.

Rwanda has not admitted to backing the M23 but has accused extremist Hutu groups in the eastern DRC of threatening its security.

Amid fears of the conflict spilling over into neighbouring countries, the AU has been criticised for its timid approach to the fighting and observers have demanded more decisive action.

DR Congo M23 rebels enter city of Bukavu

Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced from their homes in recent weeks as a result of the rebel advance.

The Rwandan-backed militants' progress comes despite international calls for a ceasefire and a resumption of peace talks.

Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance which includes M23 rebels, told Reuters news agency the rebels had entered the South Kivu provincial capital on Friday evening and would continue their advance on Saturday.

M23 rebels in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo have entered Bukavu, the eastern region's second-largest city.

Last month, the Tutsi-led M23, which is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, seized Goma, the main city in the mineral-rich east. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its resources, a claim Rwanda has denied.

The M23 briefly captured Goma in a previous conflict in 2012, but the taking of Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu province, would represent a new phase in the turbulent recent history of the region.

The city, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade.

Earlier on Friday, rebel fighters had entered the airport some 30km (19 miles) north of Bukavu, as the Congolese army and a militia allied with it withdrew without putting up much resistance.

But there were heavy clashes on the outskirts of Bukavu, South Kivu's Deputy governor Jean Elekano, had told the BBC.

In a village further north - Mayba - 70 bodies were found in a church, according to local media reports.

A local community coordinator in North Kivu, Vianney Vitswamba, told the DR Congo news agency 7Sur7 that the bodies were found tied up. Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels - an Islamic State-linked group - were blamed, but the BBC has not confirmed the report.

Residents of Bukavu contacted by the BBC said the authorities advised residents to remain indoors.

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, DR Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi called for Rwanda to be sanctioned, accusing it of having "expansionist ambitions", the AFP news agency reports.

"We will no longer put up with our strategic resources being plundered for the benefit of foreign interests under the complicit gaze of those who feed on chaos," he is quoted as saying.

As well as being accused of backing the rebels, which Rwanda has denied, the country is also said to have its own troops in eastern DR Congo.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame has said his country's priority is security. He has said Rwanda is in danger from Hutu rebels in DR Congo and has dismissed any threat of sanctions.

The news of the latest advance comes as the continent's heads of state are due to meet at an African Union (AU) summit in Ethiopia on Saturday.

The head of the AU commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat is quoted by AFP as saying that a ceasefire "must be observed" adding that "military campaigns are not going to solve these problems. There is a general mobilisation of Africa today on this issue and I hope that we will be able to impose this ceasefire".

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi traveled to Germany to attend Munich Security Conference in efforts to rally international support

The Rwanda-backed M23 fighters claim to have taken control of Kavumu airport serving Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

The airport, primarily used for NGO and military flights and where DRC troops had been stationed, was the last significant military barrier for the rebel forces before reaching the city of more than one million people – the second largest in the region – which is 30km (19 miles) away.

The rebels reportedly faced minimal resistance as they advanced through the town, with the AFP news agency reporting that Congolese military personnel vacated the airport and retreated to Bukavu.

The Reuters news agency reported that the rebel fighters also took control of Katana, a town approximately 11km (7 miles) from the airport.

The movement comes before the African Union summit that starts in Ethiopia on Saturday.

The conflict in DRC will be a key topic of discussion at the annual two-day meeting. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi had been expected to attend the summit but the country’s prime minister is now slated to replace him.

Tshisekedi attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany, in efforts to receive more international support, according to a statement from the presidency on social media on Friday.

Earlier this month, the AFC/M23 rebel coalition announced it would implement a unilateral ceasefire but resumed fighting after a two-day lull.

The outgoing chair of the African Union, Moussa Faki Mahamat, told AFP that a ceasefire in eastern DRC “must be observed”, adding that “military campaigns are not going to solve these problems.”

In late January, M23 fighters launched a rapid offensive and seized Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu. Since then, troops have been pushing southward towards Bukavu, seen as a strategic stronghold. The rebels have sought to move south following their capture of Goma, the largest city in eastern DRC.

The UN Refugee Agency says the situation is “rapidly deteriorating”, noting that the ongoing conflict has displaced about 350,000 people.

Following Goma’s fall, protests erupted in the capital Kinshasa, where demonstrators attacked a UN compound and several embassies, including those of Rwanda, France, Kenya and the United States, in response to what they perceived as foreign interference.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the fighting in South Kivu threatens to drag the entire region into a war. Congo's prime minister again called on Rwandan troops to leave the country.

Panic swept through Bukavu in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Saturday after M23 rebels entered the city in South Kivu province

People were seen fleeing in the morning, the World Food Programme said one of its warehouses was looted, and inmates from the city's main prison were freed.

Later, the streets fell quiet as residents braced for what is to come.

The rebels' self-proclaimed governor of Bukavu, Pierre Bahizi, called for calm.

"We must not leave power in the street," he said on Saturday.

The Congolese government and international observers have long accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels. Rwanda denies this.

"We are asking for one thing and cannot accept anything else: the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from Congolese territory," Congolese Prime Minister Judith Suminwa told the Reuters news agency on Saturday.

"We are an independent country and we must protect the integrity of our territory."

Guterres warns against escalation

The conflict in eastern Congo was a major topic of discussion at the African Union summit in Ethiopia on Saturday.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the summit that escalation must be avoided at all costs and with no military solution.

"The fighting that is raging in South Kivu — as a result of the continuation of the M23 offensive — threatens to push the entire region over the precipice," Guterres said without mentioning Rwanda.

He called for "diplomacy and dialogue".

"And the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC must be respected," Guterres added.

Two armies accused of backing DR Congo's feared rebels

AFP M23 rebels are accused of setting up a parallel administration in eastern DR Congo

Uganda is backing M23 rebels fighting across its border in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, UN experts say, warning that a rapidly escalating crisis “carried the risk of triggering a wider regional conflict”. The well-armed M23 is often accused of being a Rwandan proxy force, but the UN experts have put forward evidence to suggest that it also has Uganda’s support. Uganda has denied the allegations in the UN report that also accuses Rwanda of having up to 4,000 troops in DR Congo fighting alongside the rebels. In response, Rwanda did not deny the allegation and told the BBC the DR Congo government lacked the political will to resolve the crisis in its mineral-rich east, which has witnessed decades of unrest.

The UN experts said that Rwandan troops were "matching if not surpassing" the number of M23 fighters, thought to be at around 3,000 in mid-April, on Congolese soil. Rwanda has long been angered by the presence of ethnic Hutu rebels, known as the FDLR, in eastern DR Congo - joint operations in the past have failed to eliminate them. The group’s leaders are accused of taking part in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed. The Tutsi-led M23 first emerged with great ferocity in 2012, only to be defeated the following year with the help of a multinational force when most of its fighters fled to camps in Rwanda and Uganda. They began to rearm three years ago and the group now controls swathes of territory in the North Kivu province, where the UN report says M23 has installed a parallel administration. Three million people are estimated to have fled their homes because of the fighting. The UN experts’ 293-page report, which covers events up until mid-April, has just been published - but it was first handed to the UN Security Council Sanctions Committee and then sent to the UN Security Council last month. Their report also warned that Burundi’s military had been involved in operations with the Congolese army against the M23 and Rwandan soldiers, exacerbating regional tensions.

DR Congo soldiers sentenced to death for desertion

Will Félix Tshisekedi deliver war or peace for DR Congo and Rwanda? DR Congo's Foreign Minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner said she was concerned by the allegations of collusion between the Uganda army, M23 and Rwandan military. She said the issue would be taken up with Uganda with whom DR Congo has been involved in a joint offensive against another rebel group, the Islamic State-linked Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), which attacks both countries. But the UN report said it was likely that Uganda was allowing M23 supplies and new recruits through its territory. “Since the resurgence of the M23 crisis, Uganda has not prevented the presence of M23 and Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) troops on its territory or passage through it,” it said. Ugandan military intelligence officers had also been in the Congolese town of Bunagana since at least late 2023 “to co-ordinate with M23 leaders, provide logistics and transport M23 leaders to M23-controlled area”. The report also noted that M23 leaders, including its military chief Sultani Makenga - who is subject to a UN sanctions travel ban - had travelled to Uganda for meetings. Uganda deputy military spokesman, Deo Akiiki, told the Reuters news agency the allegations in the report were false: "It would be mad for us to destabilise the same area we are sacrificing it all to have it stable.”

AFP Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes as fighting intensifies between the M23 and the Congolese army and its militia allies

But the report further details Uganda’s alleged support for the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) - a newly created movement regarded by some analysts as the political arm of the M23. It is led by DR Congo’s former electoral chief and says it wants to bring peace to the east, but according to sources quoted in the UN report, it has been seen as an opportunity to legitimise the M23 “while diminishing the role of Rwanda in the crisis”. A joint AFC-M23 statement in response to a leaked version of the report said the UN experts had distorted the situation which might “obstruct the creation of lasting peace”. It also gave detailed accounts of other things it felt were incorrect, like an alleged M23 attack at Goma airport and the M23’s alleged forced recruitment and use of child soldiers, which Rwanda denies too. The AFC-M23 also denied Rwanda’s involvement in the conflict, saying the “obsession with establishing a connection between M23 and Rwanda participates in fuelling the hate ideology which is the root cause of the violence” in eastern DR Congo. The UN report said by early April 2024, the M23 and Rwanda military’s area of influence was the largest ever recorded - representing a 70% increase since November. It said that the deployment of advanced military technology and equipment bolstered joint M23-Rwandan military operations, “altering conflict dynamics” including by grounding all Congolese military “air assets”. The report included photos and screengrabs giving details of the weapons and drones used – allegedly provided to the M23 despite an arms embargo. Rwanda’s government spokesperson Yolande Makolo accused Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi of sabre-rattling. “He has also consistently threatened to declare war on Rwanda,” she told the BBC, accusing the Congolese army of financing and fighting alongside the FDLR. She said DR Congo had all the power to de-escalate the situation if it wanted to “but until then Rwanda will continue to defend itself”. A regional force from the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) was deployed at the end of last year to help DR Congo's military deal with conflicts in the east.

CNN —

Rebel forces have been seen in the center of Bukavu, the second largest city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), on Sunday, residents told CNN, as the fighters push to expand their foothold in the mineral-rich region.

Rebel coalition, Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), which includes the M23 armed group, said in a statement Saturday it had taken control of the Kavumu airport in South Kivu and forced government forces to retreat “in disarray, abandoning the city of Bukavu.”

Bukavu is the provincial capital, where residents also reported looting and fighters in the streets Saturday.

“We have control of Bukavu since this morning,” a spokesperson for the AFC rebel alliance, Victor Tesongo, told CNN Sunday.

The DRC government has not confirmed the claimed takeover. CNN has approached authorities for comment on the rebels’ claims.

Bukavu resident Elie Cirhuza told CNN he saw M23 fighters on the streets Sunday. “I saw with my eyes the soldiers of the M23. They say they will soon begin to restore order in the city,” said Cirhuza, who lives close to the city center.

He said that government troops were nowhere in sight. “I have not yet seen any government soldiers because downstairs from my house is where they gathered the night before yesterday to flee,” Cirhuza added.

A DRC military spokesperson, Sylvain Ekenge Ekenge, told Reuters on Friday that government forces had retreated from Bukavu after the rebels occupied the airport.

Another resident, Isaac Musharhamina Goldman, said the rebels have occupied strategic points in the city, including the provincial governor’s office and residence.

“They are in the three communes of the city, including the office and residence of the governor of the province, the Saïo military camp, and the site of the National Communication and Satellite Network,” he said. “They also control the two border entrances.”

According to local reports, provincial governor Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki left Bukavu before the rebels advanced into the city. CNN has reached out to him for comment.

The rapid advance into Bukavu comes less than three weeks after the rebels claimed the takeover of Goma, the largest city and capital of the neighboring North Kivu province on January 27.

Fighting in Goma between the rebels and DRC’s military left more than 3,000 people dead, according to the government.

Rebel spokesman Tesongo told CNN that the claimed capture of Goma and Bukavu marked the group’s largest territorial acquisition. The cities, with a joint population of more than three million people, are among the most populated in the DRC.

Who’s backing the rebels?

The DRC and many Western countries accuse its neighbor Rwanda of backing M23, which is comprised mainly of ethnic Tutsis who left the Congolese army more than a decade ago.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame, however, told CNN this month he was unaware whether his nation’s troops were in DRC.

Since 2022, M23 – which claims to defend the interest of minority Rwandophone communities, including the Tutsis – has waged a renewed rebellion against the DRC government, occupying a large expanse in North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.

Now a part of the AFC rebel alliance, the group has also taken over resource-rich communities in the east such as Nyabibwe and Rubaya, which harbors one of the world’s largest deposits of coltan, a valuable mineral used in the production of smartphones.

Calls for a ceasefire from foreign and regional leaders have failed to deter the rebels’ quest for territory.

UN agency says children as young as 12 are also being enlisted or coerced to join the fighting by armed groups.

Scores of children caught up in the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been subjected to sexual violence including rape by armed men, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund.

The targeting of children has soared to unprecedented levels in recent weeks, UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell warned on Thursday, making an urgent appeal for the violence to stop as Rwanda-backed M23 rebels expand their footprint, clashing with Congolese forces and their allied militias.

“In North and South Kivu provinces, we are receiving horrific reports of grave violations against children by parties to the conflict, including rape and other forms of sexual violence at levels surpassing anything we have seen in recent years,” Russell said in a statement.

Sharing the stories of some survivors, she said: “One mother recounted to our staff how her six daughters, the youngest just 12 years old, were systematically raped by armed men while searching for food.”

Another adult female rape victim also recalled a similar incident to Al Jazeera, saying that “it didn’t matter if the victim were adults or children”.

UNICEF’s accusation came as the conflict in the mineral-rich region shows no signs of abating, as M23, which captured North Kivu’s capital Goma last month, pushes further south. Thousands have been killed and tens of thousands more displaced, the UN has said.

The agency’s partners in the region reported that the number of rape cases treated across 42 health facilities jumped five-fold in one week from January 27 to February 2, Russell said.

“Of those treated, 30 percent were children. The true figures are likely much higher because so many survivors are reluctant to come forward.”

Russell added that she was “deeply alarmed by the intensifying violence”, particularly the effects on children and families.

‘All parties’ committed violence

Lianne Gutcher, UNICEF’s communication chief in DRC, told The Associated Press news agency that of the total 572 rape cases reported, 170 were children.

“It is suspected that all parties to the conflict committed sexual violence,” Gutcher said.

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Ramatou Toure, chief of child protection of UNICEF in DRC, described the situation as “extremely worrying”, noting that the armed group are using sexual violence as “weapons of war”.

“Sexual violence has become systematic,” she said, adding that some of the victims were boys.

As fighting intensifies, hundreds of children have been separated from their fleeing families, exposing them to heightened risks of violence, she added.

In just the past two weeks, more than 1,100 unaccompanied children have been identified in the two Kivu provinces, according to UNICEF.

As the rebel offensive widens, recruitment of youth by all groups is likely to accelerate, with reports of children as young as 12 being enlisted or coerced to join the fighting.

“Parties to the conflict must immediately cease and prevent grave rights violations against children,” Russell said.

M23, which UN experts say is backed by Rwanda, in recent months has swiftly seized tracts of territory in eastern DRC after again taking up arms in late 2022, in a country plagued by numerous conflicts for decades.

M23 claims to be fighting for the interests of ethnic Tutsis and has continued its military campaign in DRC despite calls from regional leaders to end the fighting.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi called for Rwanda to be "blacklisted" as rebel forces claimed more territory in the eastern part of Congo. The M23 rebels are backed by the Rwandan government.

Rwanda-backed rebels seized a second airport in eastern Congo on Friday, according to security and humanitarian sources.

M23 rebels and Rwandan troops took what was seen as the last military obstacle in the area of Kavumu, home to the airport that serves the South Kivu provincial capital of Bukavu.

The M23 group is the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo's mineral-rich east.

What was the response in Congo?

In response to the latest escalation in the conflict, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi claimed Rwanda had "expansionist ambitions" in the eastern part of Congo.

Tshisekedi called for Kigali to be subject to international sanctions while at the Munich Security Conference, adding: "What's needed is to blacklist the real culprit of this situation: Rwanda."

What did M23 say?

M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said on X that the rebels took over the Kavumu airport and its surroundings to "eliminate the threat at the source."

"The airport posed a danger to the civilian population," he added. The group was reportedly met with little resistance from those in the town.

African Union summit aims to resolve conflict

Heads of state were set to meet for talks on the crisis in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on Friday. Over the weekend the annual African Union summit will take place.

Tshisekedi will not attend the summit as he aims to focus his efforts on halting further progress of the M23 rebels, his spokesperson Tina Salama said.

Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka will instead represent Congo at the event.

Outgoing AU chair Moussa Faki Mahamat told reporters that the fighting needed to stop completely after a temporary lull earlier in the week failed to hold.

"The ceasefire must be observed," he said. "Military campaigns are not going to solve these problems. There is a general mobilization of Africa today on this issue."

In Goma, which the M23 seized in late January, they have already begun to install their own administration and establish their own police force.

M23 attacks have resulted in conflicts that have, combined with clashes from various armed groups in the region, resulted in the mass displacement of over seven million people.

The AFC/M23 rebel movement in eastern DR Congo has called for direct peace talks with the Congolese government after seizing control of Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu Province, on Sunday, February 16.

In a statement released Sunday evening, AFC/M23 said its forces entered Bukavu to "restore security" and "assist the population," adding that government forces and their allies abandoned the city, after causing insecurity, looting and committing massacres.

"Since the morning of Sunday, February 16, 2025, our forces have been working to restore the security for the people and their property, much to the satisfaction of the entire population," AFC/M23 spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka said in the statement.

The group reiterated its call for dialogue with the Kinshasa government to address the root causes of the ongoing conflict and push for governance reforms.

AFC/M23 also invited political and social forces opposed to President Félix Tshisekedi's administration to join what it described as a "constitutional struggle" for change.

The surroundings of Bukavu saw heavy fighting in recent days between the rebels and government coalition, which includes Burundian forces and FDLR and Wazalendo militias.

The fall of Bukavu city into the hands of M23 followed Friday's capture of Kavumu airport, located about 25 kilometres from the city centre. The rebels on Saturday urged Burundian forces to withdraw from DR Congo, saying their presence was unjustified.

The rebels warned that any military action against their positions could undermine peace efforts and that they would defence themselves.

"If the [Congolese army] and their allies abandon their unsuccessful military campaign, the conditions for a ceasefire will be met," Kanyuka stated.

Despite the recent losses, including the fall of Goma city in North Kivu on January 27, the Congolese government has declined talks with the rebels, saying negotiations would be a red line.

opinion

Utrecht and Dakar — "Most reporting on the conflict is using questionable framings, suggesting it is purely driven by a desire to plunder the region's rich mineral resources."

The capture of North Kivu's provincial capital, Goma, by the M23 armed group last month has multiplied international coverage of the forgotten crisis in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Yet most reporting on the conflict is using mistaken framings, suggesting it is purely driven by a desire to plunder the region's rich mineral resources.

The conflict minerals narrative contains several tropes: Proponents claim that the M23 and its Rwandan allies launched the insurgency to loot large quantities of minerals from neighbouring DRC; that Western electronics or tech corporations buy violently exploited minerals and thus become complicit in the conflict; and that the war is driven by competition for so-called critical minerals required by the energy transition.

There is nothing new or surprising about blaming the M23 crisis on greed for resources. Conflict minerals have been the primary lens through which international media have approached conflicts in eastern DRC for almost three decades.

This story has an intuitive appeal: It offers a clear narrative with a primary and very tangible culprit (Western multinationals), a direct link to the public (who own a laptop or mobile phone), and a neat solution: Stop buying 'conflict minerals' and sanction wrongdoers.

But as much as it is seductive, the narrative is incomplete and false. And, as we have seen throughout the past decade, it can be highly dangerous, leading to poor policies and failed peace efforts that ultimately hurt the very people affected by violence.

Ultimately, the conflict minerals narrative is grounded in a colonial worldview, where Western producers and consumers are the ultimate arbiters of suffering in eastern DRC. It is therefore deeply inscribed in White Saviourism. It does not acknowledge African agency, let alone account for a changing world where non-Western corporations have become major electronics producers.

Above all, the conflict minerals narrative reproduces a problematic kind of African exceptionalism. Whereas war in other settings is often acknowledged to be the product of a more complex type of geopolitics, history, and ideology, warfare in Africa is reduced to naked greed. Abandoning these tired tropes will be indispensable for creating a viable path towards peace.

Complex conflict dynamics

Natural resources do play an important role for both eastern DRC and Rwanda's political economy, and it is true that the return of the M23 in 2021 correlates with a sharp rise in Rwanda's mineral exports, as per official statistics.

Moreover, the M23 does benefit from mineral exploitation and trade. Last year, for example, the rebels seized the Rubaya mine (one of the world's biggest coltan deposits), and are now earning some $800,000 a month from taxation according to UN estimates.

However, the Rubaya takeover came more than two years after the insurgency started, and cannot therefore be considered its proximate trigger, nor do the mines constitute the group's sole means of making money.

Other flagship mines in the region (including cassiterite in Bisie) remain out of the M23's range, as do DRC's enormous deposits of copper and cobalt - a key mineral for producing electric vehicle batteries - which are concentrated in the country's southeast. This region is not affected by conflict but is part of multi-billion dollar supply chains characterised by large-scale international and domestic corruption.

What then drives the M23? On the one hand, there are the interests and ambitions of the M23's leadership. These include individual interests linked to amnesty for past violence as well as wider political and military claims. Whereas the latter initially centred on political participation and refugee return for the Congolese Tutsi community (the community from which most M23 leaders hail) the rebels are now articulating a more national agenda, threatening to march to Kinshasa, the capital. It is unclear whether that threat is rhetoric or based on a genuine plan.

On the other hand, Rwanda, which the UN says has several thousand troops supporting the M23, has had a steady interest in exerting influence over eastern DRC for the past 30 years. Not unlike DRC's other eastern neighbours, pursuing similar objectives, Rwanda's motives for influence reflect a mixture of political, security, and economic reasons, often charged with identitarian narratives. These ambitions have inspired repeated interventions from several of DRC's neighbours since the 1990s, including to fight enemies of their own that found refuge in eastern DRC.

Successive Congolese governments have helped to perpetuate this security predicament: Unable and unwilling to build an army capable of protecting territory and population, the Congolese security forces have become part of the long-standing violence in eastern DRC.

DRC also struggles to resolve deep-seated conflicts over identity, land, and authority that keep fuelling successive wars and insurgencies. Most armed groups and army factions involved in the violence, in turn, have developed a diverse range of revenue-generating activities, of which mineral exploitation and trade is but one in many options.

In sum, eastern DRC's mineral trade happens very much in symbiosis with broader instability. And as much as they are affected by conflict and play a part in it, supply chains are more complex than misleading narratives around conflict minerals suggest.

Who benefits?

Contrary to the story that the M23 has been crucial for assuring Rwanda's access to Congolese minerals, the country has such access regardless of whether it sponsors rebellion or intervenes with its own troops. To a large extent, this is because tariffs and taxes in Rwanda are lower, enticing Congolese producers to export to Rwanda both legally and illegally. This implies they do so willingly and not necessarily at gunpoint.

Nor is coltan, which transits from M23 areas through Rwanda into global supply chains, Rwanda's most important export product, ranking far behind tourism and gold in terms of export value. Gold brings in over 10 times as much as coltan.

While official gold exports by Rwanda multiplied in recent years, and much of that gold originates from DRC, the link with the M23 remains unclear. To date, the group has not advanced to any of the DRC's most important gold mining areas, whose historical commercial links span across the region, including to Kampala (Uganda) and Bujumbura (Burundi). This aligns with recent research findings that eastern DRC's gold business tends to thrive in the absence of active conflict.

Another persistent story is that Western electronics producers are the primary beneficiaries of Congolese minerals exported through Rwanda. This story focuses on coltan, which is often cited as the paradigmatic 'conflict mineral', and is needed to produce capacitors used in laptops and cell phones.

Yet it remains unclear how and why armed conflict would be beneficial to the electronics producers using coltan. And it is important to note that these are not exclusively Western, as several Asian countries are also key manufacturers of electronics.

These producers benefit most from a steady and stable supply of coltan to meet demand and keep prices low. They may consider armed conflict to be non-beneficial because it creates instability in mining areas, which can lead to supply shocks and therefore raise prices.

Another reason why armed conflict is not necessarily in electronics producers' interest is conflict minerals legislation, specifically section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act in the US and the EU Conflict Minerals Law. On paper, these laws oblige Western corporations to be transparent about their supply chains and prevent buying minerals from areas where they would finance conflict. The result has been a range of traceability initiatives that have added complex administrative layers to supply chains.

Unfortunately, a decade of experimenting with these initiatives has shown that they do little to bring peace, yet have detrimental effects on those depending on mining for their livelihoods.

One reason for this is that the operational costs of these schemes are borne by local miners and traders. Notably, this is the case with the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative (iTSCi), the first and most developed traceability programme in the region.

Strikingly, iTSCi imposes higher operational costs in DRC than in Rwanda. Rather than improving supply chain oversight, iTSCi has therefore encouraged the smuggling of Congolese minerals to Rwanda, independently of the M23 rebellion.

Recent calls, meanwhile, for banning minerals from DRC and Rwanda - which electronics producer Apple already abides by, after the Congolese government launched a complaint against its European subsidiaries - could have dire consequences for the thousands of people depending on artisanal mining for their livelihoods.

The perverse effects of conflict minerals initiatives remind us that inaccurate narratives on the conflict in eastern DRC are not only an inconvenience but can further exacerbate the very problems they pretend to tackle.

Oakland, California, Usa — The fresh offensive by the M23 rebels and Rwanda forces in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) coincides with the first anniversary of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the European Union (EU) and Rwanda to cooperate on the supply of "critical minerals."

The agreement could not be more appalling given its total disregard of Rwanda's role in driving the violent conflict raging in Eastern DRC for the last thirty years, either directly through its own forces, or by supporting armed groups to fight on its behalf. The consequence has been deaths of millions, along with massive displacement and immense suffering for the Congolese.

President Paul Kagame of Rwanda justifies the war, citing concerns for peace and security for the Tutsi ethnic group, target of the 1994 genocide. It is, however, Rwanda's illicit extraction of eastern Congo's highly lucrative minerals including gold and the world's largest reserves of cobalt (used in batteries) and coltan (used in modern technological devices), that is fueling this devastation.

Rwanda's support of the rebel group M23 has allowed it to take over much of eastern Congo, capture many mines, and perpetrate massacres and egregious human rights abuses.

While it is wrong and immoral for the EU to strike a deal with a country responsible for so much suffering, the very terms of the February 2024 agreement make it worse as they overlook the role of Rwanda in illicit extraction.

Over the past decade, Rwanda has exported far higher quantities of coltan than its own mines produce. It is estimated that up to 90 percent of Rwanda's coltan exports are illegally sourced from eastern DRC, through what the NGO Global Witness has dubbed as a massive "laundromat."

Yet, the European bureaucrats who worded the agreement stated that "[Rwanda] is a major player on the world's tantalum extraction. It also produces tin, tungsten, gold and niobium, and has potential for lithium and rare earth elements.

In addition, Rwanda with its favorable investment climate and rule of law can become a hub for value addition in the mineral sector. One gold refinery already exists, while a tantalum refinery will soon be operational."

The EU - like the US - has legislation in place that is supposed to prevent the use of conflict minerals from DRC but the MOU's more than favorable terms to describe Rwanda and its business climate suggest a deliberate choice not to enforce European laws despite the country's well documented egregious records.

Losing hope with Western regulators, last month, DRC filed criminal complaints against subsidiaries of Apple in France and Belgium, accusing the tech firm of using conflict minerals in its supply chain. Lawyers for the DRC government claim that Apple is responsible for "covering up war crimes and the laundering of tainted minerals, handling stolen goods, and carrying out deceptive commercial practices to assure consumers supply chains are clean."

This complaint speaks to the blatant failure of the traceability schemes that have supposedly been put in place to address the issue of "conflict minerals." Since 2010, the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative is supposed to ensure upstream traceability in the African Great Lakes Region. It operates at over 2,000 mines and has been endorsed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

Unfortunately, instead of restricting the entry of conflict minerals into global supply chains, the scheme has been used to illegally launder conflict-minerals from DRC or smuggled into neighboring countries. This has allowed illegally tagged minerals to ultimately end up in the products of brands such as Apple, Intel, Samsung, Nokia, Motorola, and Tesla.

The horrors unleashed due to conflict minerals in Eastern DRC are well known to governments, corporations and their shareholders. For years, the United Nations has sounded the alarm over Rwanda's continued assistance to the M23, documenting the direct involvement of its armed forces in the conflict and the supply of weapons and ammunitions to the rebels.

Yet, Western countries remain long-time supporters. From 2001 to 2022, the US alone provided over US$3.9 billion in economic aid to Rwanda and waited until October 2023 to place Rwanda on a blacklist for military aid for violating the Child Soldiers Prevention Act due to Rwandan support for M23, which recruits child soldiers.

The UK has been hesitant to criticize Rwanda, let alone cut off military aid, as it was negotiating a migrant deportation pact with the country. While France and the EU have publicly denounced Rwanda, neither have cut off military aid, and continue cooperation as demonstrated by the critical minerals deal.

In a March 2023 press conference with President Tshisekedi, when asked if France would pursue sanctions against Rwanda, President Macron's response blamed the Congolese government for country's instability.

In addition to the violence, the on-going war and exploitation of DRC's mineral resources has a dire impact on the country's economy, draining its financial resources and preventing revenue from mineral extraction to reach its coffers. Poverty and hunger are widespread whereas access to basic services such as health and education are greatly underfunded.

The situation of countries not benefiting economically from their own natural resources has been labelled as a "resource curse." However, looking at the forces driving and profiteering from the exploitation and violence, it is not the curse but rather the greed and cynical attitude of governments and corporate actors that is responsible.

On January 25, 2025, the EU said that "Rwanda must cease its support for the M23 and withdraw," and warned that it "will consider all the tools at its disposal in order to hold accountable those responsible for sustaining armed conflict, instability and insecurity in the DRC." Sanctions on Rwanda are obviously long overdue.

An easy first step for European countries will be to end the agreement that should have never been signed in the first place. The next step must be enforcement of conflict minerals regulations and laws they have conveniently failed to apply so far.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Soldiers from Burundi have deployed to troubled eastern Congo as the first part of a recently created East African regional force to respond to crises.

“As you have seen, our soldiers have been received officially. They are in Congo on an official mission,” the spokesman for Burundi’s army, Col. Floribert Biyereke, told The Associated Press on Monday. He said a battalion had been sent.

The deployment was confirmed by a Congolese army spokesman, Lt. Marc Elongo, who said the mandate is to track down “all foreign and local armed groups in order to restore peace” in the mineral-rich region bordering Rwanda and Uganda where dozens of rebel groups operate.

The tensions between Congo and Rwanda, which Congo has accused of supporting the recently resurgent M23 rebel group, in part led the East African Community to create the regional force earlier this year. Rwanda in turn accuses Congo of backing another rebel group, the FDLR, which Rwanda considers a threat.

Burundi also borders Congo, and the presence of its soldiers there concerns some observers. Carina Tertsakian with the Burundian Human Rights Initiative told the AP that the soldiers might pursue another rebel group, RED-Tabara, that has been accused of carrying out attacks inside Burundi.

“It is no surprise that Burundi is the first country to offer troops,” Tertsakian said, asserting that hundreds of Burundian forces already had been quietly deployed in Congo for several months on that mission.

“Burundi is a direct party to the conflict, so cannot be viewed as a neutral actor,” she said, adding that Burundian security forces have a long record of human rights abuses. “It therefore seems unlikely that their deployment will end the insecurity in the area.”

CNN —

A rampaging rebel group has claimed the capture of another mining town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a little over a week after it took control of the region’s largest city Goma.

Clashes between the rebel coalition Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) and Congolese forces have left more than 3,000 people dead in less than two weeks, according to DRC’s government.

The AFC, of which the M23 armed group – which claims to defend the interest of minority Rwandophone communities – is a key member, took over resource-rich Nyabibwe last week after Goma, the provincial capital of North Kivu, fell on January 27.

It comes less than a year after the rebels seized Rubaya, a mining hub also in the country’s east, which harbors one of the world’s largest deposits of coltan, a valuable mineral used in the production of smartphones.

Here’s what you need to know.

Is my phone fueling the conflict?

For decades, DRC, a Central African nation of more than 100 million people, has grappled with bloody militia violence, including ethnic and resource-driven armed rebellion by M23 and dozens of other armed groups.

Roughly the size of Western Europe, the war-riven country is endowed with vast mineral wealth, including the world’s largest reserves of cobalt and coltan – both critical to the production of electronics. Cobalt is used to produce batteries that power cell phones and electric vehicles, while coltan is refined into tantalum, which has a variety of applications in phones and other devices.

However, according to the World Bank “most people in DRC have not benefited from this wealth,” and the country ranks among the five poorest nations in the world.

Much of DRC’s mineral wealth is split between its government and armed groups who control swathes of the resource-rich east.

“Access to natural resources is at the heart of this conflict,” Jean Pierre Okenda, an analyst specializing in extractive industries governance, told CNN about the M23-led takeover of territories in the east.

“It’s not a coincidence that the zones occupied by the rebels are mining areas,” Okenda said, adding that global demand for cobalt and coltan has fueled the crisis.

“It takes money to wage war. Access to mining sites finances the war,” he added.

Why do the rebels want the minerals?

Victor Tesongo, a spokesperson for the AFC-M23 rebel alliance, told CNN that the group was in control of the coltan-rich Rubaya and Nyabibwe mines, but stopped short of saying how much money it has derived from them or what it has been spent on.

But a top United Nations official has an idea.

Bintou Keita, the UN Secretary General’s Special Representative to the DRC, told the Security Council in a September briefing that coltan trade from Rubaya’s mines is estimated to supply over 15 percent of global tantalum production and generates an estimated $300,000 in revenue a month for M23.

M23 denied these claims, insisting its presence in Rubaya was “solely humanitarian.”

Much of the international community, including the Congolese government, has accused neighboring Rwanda of backing M23 and aiding the plunder of DRC minerals.

UN experts believe that an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan soldiers are supervising and supporting M23 fighters in eastern DRC, outnumbering the rebel group’s forces in the country. A December report by the UN Group of Experts on the DRC revealed that “at least 150 tons of coltan were fraudulently exported to Rwanda and mixed with Rwandan production.”

DRC Communications Minister Patrick Muyaya told CNN last week that “Rwanda’s mineral exports surged after its forces took control of key mining zones in DRC.”

Rwanda is one of the world’s top suppliers of coltan and has surpassed DRC’s export of the mineral in recent years.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame told CNN last week that his country gets coltan from its mines and said that he didn’t know whether Rwandan troops were in DRC.

Where do DRC’s plundered minerals go?

In a public address that drew outrage last year, Kagame admitted that Rwanda was a transit point for minerals smuggled from DRC, but insisted his country was not stealing from its neighbor.

“Some people come from Congo; whether they smuggle or go through the right channels, they bring minerals. Most of it goes through here (Rwanda) but does not stay here. It goes to Dubai, Brussels, Tel Aviv, (and) Russia. It goes everywhere,” Kagame said, without providing evidence or specifying what minerals were being smuggled.

CNN has reached out to his government’s spokesperson for comment.

In 2022, the United States Treasury Department said that over 90% of DRC’s gold was being “smuggled to regional states, including Uganda and Rwanda” where they are “refined and exported to international markets, particularly the UAE,” and sanctioned a Belgian businessman for facilitating the trade.

For DRC’s other valuable minerals including coltan and cobalt, the scale of the plunder remains unclear.

In December, DRC sued subsidiaries of Apple in Belgium and France, accusing the company of sourcing conflict minerals. Apple denied the accusation.

Every year, tech giants such as Apple and Microsoft publish reports saying that they demand responsible sourcing of minerals from their suppliers.

In an earlier filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023, Apple said that while it continued to source 3TG (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) and other minerals such as cobalt and lithium from DRC and other countries, it was “committed to meeting and exceeding internationally accepted due diligence standards for primary minerals and recycled materials in our supply chain.” It added that its due diligence efforts had “found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023 directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country.”

Is there a solution to the conflict?

DRC’s mineral wealth has presented itself as a “curse,” according to analyst Okenda, who explained:

“These resources create wars, create rebellions, expose local populations, and also create serious ecological problems,” he told CNN.

Last week, a humanitarian ceasefire announced by M23 fell apart almost immediately after it was declared, as the rebels swiftly advanced into Nyabibwe.

While regional and global leaders ponder solutions to ending the crisis, Okenda believes that DRC’s government needs to reinvent itself if it hopes for lasting peace.

DRC “has a governance model that if it does not change, the Congolese population will gain absolutely nothing, whether there is war or not,” he said.

“If the Kinshasa government improves its governance, invests in the army, ensures a fair sharing of resources between citizens in the country, and conducts elections that are of better quality, I still think that peace can return (to DRC),” he said.

Fighting is raging in eastern Congo despite the government signing a ceasefire agreement with the M23 rebels. Civilians are trapped in a violent spiral involving M23 rebels, SADC troops and other militia groups.

Clashes between Congolese government forces and the M23 rebel group are continuing in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Worryingly, they are edging closer to densely populated areas between Lake Edward and north of Lake Kivu, relatively close to the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. On Sunday, August 25, some reports suggested that the M23 had captured the town of Kirumba, an important regional hub.

It follows a string of captured towns by the M23, sometimes even without a fight, since a ceasefire in July was agreed. The M23 has accumulated vast swathes of territory since it re-emerged from dormancy in 2021. The well-armed group is widely believed to be supported militarily and logistically by Rwanda.

"Goma is isolated as the capital of the North Kivu. There is no way to move to the north because Nyiragongo the M23 already seized the place," Goma-based political commentator Jack Kahorha told DW. He said the transport route which delivers food and other supplies has been disrupted.

M23 ties to Rwanda

Kinshasa accuses Rwanda of increasingly overt support for the M23 rebels, from arms and ammunition to personnel. Rwanda denies the claim but, in February, admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border.

Observers say Rwanda wants to exert influence over the vast eastern DRC region for economic and security reasons. The territory holds significant natural resources such as timber, rare earth minerals and gold. The area also harbors Hutu extremist militias, whom Kigali accuses of being responsible for the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi.

"If you look at Rwanda's President Paul Kagame's governance since the early 90s, much of it has hinged on building an ideology around himself and the counter-genocide doctrine that Kagame is the protector," Daniel van Dalen, a South African-based risk analyst, told DW.

Rwanda and the DRC 'want peace'

Instability in the eastern DRC, which started in the mid-1990s, has led to nearly six million deaths. More than 120 militia and armed rebel groups roam the provinces of Ituri, North Kivu, South Kivu, and Tanganyika. Many of these rebels commit atrocities and violations against civilians, according to the UN.

The UN estimates fighting has driven more than 1.7 million people from their homes in North Kivu, taking the total number of Congolese displaced by multiple conflicts to a record 7.2 million.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda's Paul Kagame, who recently began a new term, have voiced a desire for peace and stability in the eastern DRC, but Kahorha is not optimistic. "The way the situation is going now, there isno hope for a solution if peace dialogue is not engaged," Kahorha said, adding that the eastern DRC has been embroiled in conflict for the past 30 years now. "It has become a never-ending crisis."

SADC forces battling M23 rebels

But it is the current offensive by the M23 rebels and their disregard for the ceasefire that alarms observers. M23's onslaught comes despite the deployment of a Southern African Development Community (SADC) mission to eastern Congo to combat the M23 rebel group.

In December 2023, SADC sent a military force to aid the Congolese government to push out the rebels. So far, the SADC troops have failed to halt the M23 rebels, who keep seizing more territory.

Speaking exclusively to DW on SADC's deployment, Malawian President Lazarus Chakwera stressed that the troops' top priority is protecting innocent lives. "Peace is a prerequisite for development. Whether it is proxy wars or to do with who has power over this resource or that resource, it's a decision that says 'make sure that we protect vulnerable communities'."

But, SADC's force is not of a peacekeeping nature. "SADC's mission mandate is to actively fight M23," Daniel van Dalen said. "It's coincidental, maybe not so coincidental, that you had the contributing members to the SADC force now are the exact same ones that were part of the UN's Force Intervention Brigade in 2012, that basically defeated M23. But they're now just doing it in their own capacity."

With SADC forces effectively taking on a Rwandan proxy at the request of the Congolese government (a SADC member), more geopolitical complications could emerge. SADC and Rwandan troops joined forces, largely successfully, to drive out Islamist forces in northern Mozambique.

However, according to van Dalen, SADC's military mission in the eastern DRC is likely to test future military cooperation. "They [SADC troops] are not fighting just a rebel. They're fighting one of the most capable militaries on the continent, through Rwanda, and a rebel group that is being equipped with advanced weapons," van Dalen said, adding that SADC's lack of air support has hampered their effectiveness.

A mystery disease is spreading in the Panzi health zone of Kwango Province, Democratic Republic of Congo, primarily affecting children under five and severely malnourished individuals. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 406 cases between October 24 and December 5, with 31 deaths. Symptoms include fever, headache, cough, runny nose, and body aches.

The outbreak is occurring in a rural and remote area, with access further complicated by heavy rains and limited healthcare diagnostics. These challenges have delayed identifying the cause of the disease. WHO teams have been deployed to investigate, collect samples for laboratory testing, and provide treatment to affected patients.

Malaria, a common disease in the region, may be contributing to the outbreak, alongside other possible factors such as acute pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, measles, and severe malnutrition. Experts have not ruled out the possibility that multiple diseases are responsible for the reported cases and deaths. Efforts are ongoing to contain the outbreak and identify its cause.

CNN —

A rebel alliance claimed the capture of the biggest city in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s mineral-rich eastern region this week, pushing back against resistance from government troops backed by regional and UN intervention forces.

The takeover of Goma is yet another territorial gain for the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC) rebel coalition, which includes the M23 armed group – sanctioned by the United States and the United Nations.

It is also a swift expansion of the alliance’s foothold across swathes of eastern DR Congo – where rare minerals crucial to the production of phones and computers are mined – and is likely to worsen a long-running humanitarian crisis in the region.

“AFC-M23 controls Goma,” Victor Tesongo, an AFC spokesperson, told CNN Monday, adding that “Goma fell under pressure” after the group’s earlier seizure of the nearby towns of Minova and Saké.

The Congolese government has yet to confirm the rebels’ takeover but acknowledges their presence in the city, capital of the eastern North Kivu province. It announced Sunday it had cut diplomatic ties with neighboring Rwanda, which it accuses of equipping the group with both weapons and troops, and recalled its diplomatic staff from the nation. A Rwandan government spokesperson did not deny or confirm the country’s support for M23 when asked by CNN.

More than a dozen foreign peacekeepers, as well as the military governor of North Kivu province, have been killed in recent days trying to fend off the rebels, as thousands of locals flee their advance into Goma.

What are the latest developments?

South Africa’s military confirmed Tuesday that four more South African soldiers deployed in DR Congo as part of the UN peacekeeping mission there had died, only days after nine were killed in the fighting.

Meanwhile, aid agencies said that hospitals were overwhelmed as hundreds of people caught in the crossfire in Goma sought treatment for injuries, among them seriously wounded children. Amid the fighting, food assistance programs in and around the city have been temporarily paused, the World Food Programme said Tuesday.

There were “many dead bodies” in the city’s streets, said Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the UN humanitarian office. Fighters had reportedly raped civilians, and property had also been looted, he said. Among those killed was a famed Congolese boxer, Balezi Bagunda, according to Matthew Leutwyler, the founder of the non-profit We Are Limitless, who had been working with him to evacuate local children the organization works with.

The Red Cross warned on Tuesday that the unrest in the city could lead to the spread of viruses, including Ebola, if laboratories with samples of the disease are affected by the violence.

Patrick Youssef, regional director for Africa at the International Committee of the Red Cross, said that his organization is “very concerned” that a biomedical laboratory in Goma could be impacted by the disorder there. “It’s a center very close to our delegation,” he said.

Meanwhile, in the national capital, Kinshasa, protesters gathered and fires were lit outside a number of Western and African embassies, including that of Rwanda. The French embassy was “attacked and firebombed,” the French foreign ministry told CNN, but protesters were unable to enter the site’s perimeter.

Later on Tuesday, the US Embassy in Kinshasa advised US citizens to leave the city. “Due to an increase in violence throughout the city of Kinshasa, the US Embassy in Kinshasa advises US citizens to shelter-in-place and then safely depart while commercial options are available,” a statement from the embassy said.

Reports emerged Monday of Congolese troops exchanging fire with Rwandan soldiers along their shared border as fear of a blown-out war grows.

Earlier that day, gunfire rang out from Goma’s airport after it was shut by the rebels; a French intelligence source told CNN M23 had gained full control of the facility on Tuesday. At the same time, more than 4,000 prisoners broke free from a correctional facility, the UN-funded Radio Okapi reported, compounding chaotic scenes witnessed in the city.

In a statement Monday, the Uruguayan army, whose troops are part of the UN peacekeeping mission in Goma, said “hundreds” of Congolese soldiers had laid down their weapons following a 48-hour ultimatum by M23.

Rwandan national broadcaster also shared footage of Congolese soldiers surrendering their arms to Rwandan forces at a Rwandan border post after fleeing Goma.

How did the conflict escalate?

DR Congo has experienced decades of militia violence, including armed rebellion by M23, which claims to defend the interest of the minority Rwandophone communities, including the Tutsi.

Since 2022, M23 has waged a renewed rebellion against the Congolese government, occupying a large expanse in North Kivu, which borders Rwanda and Uganda.

For several months, the rebels have also controlled Rubaya, a mining town in North Kivu that harbors one of the world’s largest coltan deposits. This valuable mineral is used in the production of mobile phones.

Bintou Keita, who heads the UN mission in DR Congo, told the Security Council in a September briefing that “competition over exploitation and trade of natural resources” had escalated conflict between armed groups in the country’s east.

According to Keita, coltan trade from the M23-controlled Rubaya mining site is estimated to “supply over 15 percent of global tantalum production” , and “generates an estimated $300,000 in revenue per month to the armed group.”

M23 denied these claims, insisting its presence in the Rubaya area was “solely humanitarian.”

A report by the UN Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo, released in December, revealed that “at least 150 tons of coltan were fraudulently exported to Rwanda and mixed with Rwandan production.”

Since April last year, the report said, M23, “with RDF (Rwanda Defence Force) support, has made significant territorial gains and strengthened control over occupied areas,” adding that such a pattern suggested “that the true objective of M23 remained territorial expansion and the long-term occupation and exploitation of conquered territories.”

The report added that the RDF’s military interventions “were critical to the impressive territorial expansion achieved” by M23.

Why is Goma important?

Goma is home to around two million people and is the largest city in North Kivu. M23’s incursion on Monday was the second time the group had moved to capture the provincial capital after it briefly took control in 2012.

M23 spokesman Willy Ngoma told CNN on Saturday that his group was motivated by concern for the residents of Goma, which is home to minority groups such as the Congolese Tutsi community.

“We do not want to capture Goma but to liberate it,” he said. “The population is in distress; we must save it as quickly as possible.”

Prof. Dady Saleh, a Congolese political and economic analyst, told CNN there was more to M23’s interest in Goma.

“Goma is a strategic and highly symbolic city with an international airport, as well as proximity to Rwanda and Lake Kivu, opening the easy path with South Kivu,” he said.

But, most importantly, Saleh said, Goma’s fall to M23 “will be the symbol of its complete and total capture” of the eastern part of the DRC.”

M23’s self-proclaimed liberation agenda has been scarred by a long trail of alleged human rights violations and what rights group Human Rights Watch described in 2023 as “war crimes against civilians” in North Kivu. The group has consistently denied such claims.

Fighting between M23, Congolese forces and other rebel groups has also forced many from their homes in the country’s east, with at least 400,000 people displaced just since the beginning of this year in North and South Kivu, the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR said in a statement.

UNHCR spokesperson Matt Saltmarsh added that “bombs have fallen” on camps housing those who’ve fled, resulting in civilian deaths, including of children.

This is a huge concern for aid groups operating in the area, such as Mercy Corps. Its country director for DR Congo, Rose Tchwenko, told CNN in a statement that Goma, which she described as a “lifeline of humanitarian operations across eastern DRC” was now “perilously close to breaking.”

“Humanitarian access is nearly impossible, resources are stretched to their limits, and displaced families are left in dire need of food, clean water, medicine, and shelter,” Tchwenko said.

What’s at stake for Rwanda?

UN experts believe that an estimated 3,000 Rwandan soldiers operate alongside M23 fighters in eastern DR Congo, outnumbering the rebel group’s number in the country.

According to Saleh, the Congolese analyst, Rwanda does not just support M23, “it (Rwanda) is the M23.”

Western nations, such as the US, Britain, and France, have censured Kigali’s support for the group.

Rwanda government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told CNN that her country “will do what is necessary to defend our borders and protect Rwandans.”

She cited a UN report that found evidence DR Congo’s military had collaborated and carried out joint operations with a Hutu militia group against a mainly Tutsi rebel group, the CNDP, which M23 grew out of.

Hutu militias carried out the genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994.

“This is happening right next to our border,” Makolo said of the insecurity in eastern DR Congo, adding that “the President of the DRC has said publicly that his enemy is President (Paul) Kagame and the Rwandan Government, and that he will ‘liberate’ Rwandans.”

Rwanda’s foreign ministry also blamed DR Congo’s government for failing to engage in dialogue with M23, describing it as a “Congolese rebel group fighting to protect their community in eastern DRC.”

CNN has contacted the Congolese military and government spokesperson for comment on the country’s alleged collaboration with the Hutu militia group and threats against Rwanda.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi has previously threatened to go to war with Rwanda. Rwandan leader Kagame has responded in kind.

“We are ready to fight,” Kagame told French network France 24 in June last year, adding: “We are not afraid of anything.”

When the UN Security Council convened on Sunday for an emergency meeting on the crisis, DR Congo’s foreign minister Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner said Rwanda’s role in the conflict was “a declaration of war that no longer hides itself behind diplomatic maneuvers.”

Is there a route to peace?

Eastern African leaders plan to convene an emergency meeting within 48 hours to find solutions to the crisis, Kenya’s President William Ruto said Monday, urging Tshisekedi and Kagame “to heed the call for peace.”

Previous interventions led by Angola, including truce agreements, have failed to cease hostilities.

“A solution is still in sight,”Saleh told CNN, especially if the leaders meet as planned.

“But it is rather the quality of the solutions in sight that is the real question,” he said.

“The region needs a lasting solution to the security situation, and to achieve this, one of the conditions is that the DRC must be able to ensure its security and control its economy. Solutions in terms of power-sharing, tribal and ethnic integration are not a lasting solution.”

Between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwanda government forces are deployed in neighbouring eastern Congo, operating alongside the M23 rebel group which has been making major advances, U.N. experts said in a report circulated Wednesday.

The experts called the estimate of Rwandan troops "conservative" and said their "systematic support and presence" supporting M23 in its territorial conquest is a sanctionable act, and their deployment is a violation of Congo's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

The Rwandan forces' "de facto control and direction over M23 operations also renders Rwanda liable for the actions of M23," the panel of experts said in the 293-page report to the U.N. Security Council.

Eastern Congo has struggled with armed violence as more than 120 groups fight for power, land and valuable mineral resources, while others try to defend their communities. Some armed groups have been accused of mass killings.

Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi and U.S. and U.N. experts have accused Rwanda of giving military backing to M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February it effectively admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border.

At the root of the current crisis is the 1994 Rwanda genocide. The carnage began when a plane carrying Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was shot down, killing the leader, who like most Rwandans was an ethnic Hutu. The country's minority Tutsis were blamed, and bands of Hutu extremists began killing them with support from Rwanda's army, police and militias.

Rwanda's current president, Paul Kagame, a Tutsi and former opposition military commander, is widely credited with stopping the genocide which killed more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus who tried to protect them. Thousands of Hutus fled Rwanda to neighbouring eastern Congo.

The M23 rebels are largely Congolese ethnic Tutsis, who became prominent when their fighters seized Goma, eastern Congo's largest city on the border with Rwanda, in November 2012.

Rwandan Ambassador Ernest Rwamucyo told the Security Council Monday that Congo and the international community have failed to ensure the protection of Congolese citizens, especially Congolese Tutsis, who he claimed "are being ethnically cleansed by armed groups."

He reiterated that the FDLR rebel group — which he said is supported by Congo's highest authorities and has vowed to cause regime change in Rwanda — remains "a threat to Rwanda and the Great Lakes region." The FDLR is comprised mainly of Hutus opposed to Tutsi influence and reportedly includes some Hutus who participated in the Rwanda genocide.

The panel of experts said the estimated 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan troops in Congo were deployed in three regions of eastern North Kivu – Nyiragongo, Rutshuru and Masisi – when their report was drafted in April. It said the troops were from the military's 2nd and 3rd divisions, citing intelligence and security sources close to M23 and the Rwandan military and confidential documents.

The experts said Rwandan military interventions and operations in the three territories "were critical to the impressive territorial expansion achieved between January and March 2024."

The top U.N. official in Congo, special envoy Bintou Keita, told the council Monday that she was extremely concerned at the continuing rapid expansion of attacks by the M23 rebel group and its capture of several strategic locations in eastern North Kivu in the last two weeks, and the spillover into neighbouring South Kivu.

A two-week humanitarian truce began last Friday in eastern Congo, but there has been no indication the violence has stopped.

The experts said they documented the proliferation and use of advanced military technology and equipment, mainly from Rwanda, by M23 and Rwandan forces in violation of a U.N. arms embargo. It cited short-range air defence systems, mortar shells carried by drones, and 120mm guided mortar shells with "precision strike capability and high lethality."

The experts said these advances altered the "conflict dynamics" including by grounding all Congolese military air assets.

In December, a new political-military movement called the Alliance Fleuve Congo, or AFC was launched to unite armed groups, political parties and civil society against Congo's government. But the experts said the AFC "failed to coalesce the majority of political and armed actors against the government."

Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have seized a strategic eastern town near the provincial capital Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, local politicians said Sunday.

The Tutsi-led M23 group has been waging a renewed insurgency in eastern Congo since 2022. Congo and the United Nations accuse neighboring Rwanda of backing the group with its own troops and weapons. Rwanda says it has taken what it calls defensive measures.

Fighting has flared in recent weeks, leading to territorial gains for M23, which is now in control of Masisi, a town and local administrative center about 80 km (50 miles) from Goma, provincial parliament member Alexis Bahunga told Reuters.

"The government will take measures to restore state authority over the entire territory," he said.

Another parliamentary deputy, Jean-Pierre Ayobangira Safari, said Masisi had been taken "for now."

An army spokesperson declined immediate comment.

Corneille Nangaa, leader of the anti-government Congo River Alliance (AFC), which includes M23, said rebel forces had reached the center of Masisi mid-afternoon on Saturday.

The advance and continued fighting in defiance of a ceasefire agreement further undermined efforts to curb the conflict. A rare high-level meeting between the Congolese and Rwandan presidents was postponed in December, dashing hopes of a deal to curb the violence that has displaced more than 1.9 million people.

The head of an international organization working in Masisi said staff members there were in shock and unable to continue operations as businesses were closed, making it hard to source supplies.

"They don't know how to leave the town since we fear that the ... [Congolese forces] will launch a counteroffensive," the source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

The tech giant has been accused of sourcing conflict minerals from sub-Saharan Africa.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has filed criminal complaints against tech giant Apple’s subsidiaries in France and Belgium over the use of “conflict minerals” in their supply chains.

Lawyers representing the Central African country, claimed in a statement this week that Apple’s subsidiaries in Europe are using conflict minerals sourced in sub-Saharan Africa and accused the company of “using deceptive commercial practices to assure consumers that the tech giant’s supply chains are clean”.

So, what are conflict minerals and why has Apple been accused?

What are conflict minerals?

They are minerals which are typically sourced from high-risk areas afflicted by conflict.

The war-ravaged DRC, Sierra Leone and Venezuela are among those countries in which such minerals are found.

“Conflict minerals is a term given by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold sourced from so-called conflict-affected and high-risk areas,” Christoph N Vogel, author of the book Conflict Minerals Inc, told Al Jazeera.

In a report published in October this year, the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) noted that various industries around the world mainly use four conflict minerals – tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold.

Tantalum is mostly used to manufacture capacitors which store electrical energy in cell phones, computers and also turbines in jet engines.

Tin is used in automobile parts and food packaging.

Tungsten is also used to manufacture automobiles and cutting tools, and is the key element used in light bulbs.

Gold is used as jewellery and also in electronics like laptops and cell phones.

Many human rights organisations have also noted that conditions for workers in the mines are often very poor, and can involve slavery and unpaid work.

Which conflict minerals are mined in the DRC?

According to the US GAO report, the eastern part of the DRC is one of the key areas in the world rich in the four listed minerals – tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold – collectively called the 3TGs.

This part of the DRC has been ravaged by violence for more than 30 years. At least 200 armed groups there have been vying for control of the mines from which these minerals are sourced.

Alex Kopp, senior campaigner at the Global Witness NGO’s transition minerals team, told Al Jazeera that in the DRC, “they [rebels] occupy mines and also the trading routes. They basically force the workers in the mines to work for free for a day per week and they illegally smuggle the minerals through places like Rwanda. The minerals then get exported legally and may end up in the supply chains of big electronic and tech companies.”

Why are conflict minerals so controversial?

Profits from the minerals are believed to prop up armed groups’ activities.

Cobb said the Rwandan-backed armed group M23, for example, is believed to control coltan production in the Rubaya area of DRC. This region supplies about 15 percent of the world’s tantalum, the metal into which coltan, used in the manufacture of mobile phones and laptops, is processed.

“The price of exported coltan was between $39 and $43 per kilo between January and May 2024, according to the Rwandan central bank,” Kopp said.

Vogel said profits from the mines add to those made through other enterprises. “Mines come into play when there is no easier or better option – but often there is. They make more money through roadside taxation initiatives, customs etc,” he said.

Why is the DRC accusing Apple of being involved in this?

The DRC’s scrutiny of Apple’s use of minerals in the region began in September last year when the country’s president, Felix Tshisekedi, met lawyers from Amsterdam & Partners LLP – the main legal firm representing the country in the conflict minerals case – in Kinshasa.

According to a statement from the law firm, Tshisekedi ordered the lawyers to investigate the supply chain of “3T minerals (tin, tungsten and tantalum) sourced from Congolese territory and illegally exported”.

On April 22 this year, the lawyers contacted Apple CEO Tim Cook after their research revealed Apple’s supply chain could be “tainted by blood minerals pillaged from the country [DRC]”, referring to the 3T minerals. The company’s firms in France were also notified. But, the lawyers say, they did not receive a reply for several months.

Back then, Apple told Reuters: “We found no reasonable basis for concluding that any of the smelters or refiners of 3TG determined to be in our supply chain as of December 31, 2023, directly or indirectly financed or benefited armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country.”

On December 17, the lawyers representing the DRC filed criminal complaints against Apple’s branches in Europe in courts in France and Belgium.

Robert Amsterdam, one of the lawyers involved in the case, said: “Colour Apple red, and not green. It is a trillion-dollar company that must be assumed to know the consequences of its actions. Enough with denials of accountability and hiding behind the false narrative of supply chain defences!”

How has Apple responded?

Apple denies the allegations. In a media statement on Tuesday, Apple said: “As conflict in the region escalated earlier this year we notified our suppliers that their smelters and refiners must suspend sourcing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold from the DRC and Rwanda.

“We took this action because we were concerned it was no longer possible for independent auditors or industry certification mechanisms to perform the due diligence required to meet our high standards.” The group added that minerals used in Apple gadgets are recycled.

On Wednesday, the lawyers representing the DRC said Apple’s statements were “satisfactory” but needed to be verified on the ground.

Will the case proceed?

Yes. The lawyers said they will continue to press their case against Apple’s branches in Europe.

“These complaints filed against Apple are a matter of great public interest at a time when European countries, consumers and non-governmental organisations are increasing their scrutiny of international supply chains,” Christophe Marchand, the case’s lawyer in Brussels said in a statement.

Why is the case being prosecuted in Europe?

The 27-member European Union (EU) has regulations in place to ensure its “importers of 3TG meet international responsible sourcing standards, set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); ensure that global and EU smelters and refiners of 3TG source responsibly; help break the link between conflict and the illegal exploitation of minerals, and help put an end to the exploitation and abuse of local communities, including mine workers, and support local development.”

The lawyers have, therefore, also written to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen demanding that she address the EU’s accountability for ending “armed violence in sub-Saharan Africa’s mineral supply chains”.

So far, according to the DRC lawyers’ spokesperson, they have not received a response.

“DRC wants to achieve the denunciation of the crimes and a change in the supply chains through these lawsuits,” the spokesperson for the lawyers added.

Have other companies used conflict minerals?

Global Witness traced supply chains globally and identified companies that have sourced or smuggled conflict minerals.

“We have found these minerals may end up in products by international brands such as Apple, Intel, Samsung, Nokia, Motorola and Tesla,” a May 2022 report by the NGO found.

“Many international companies sourcing 3T minerals for their products, including for computers, electronics and cars, arguably do too little to detect smuggling, fraud, conflict links and child labour in the supply chain,” the report noted. It added that companies like Apple have been warned about how their minerals are sourced and smuggled, but have applied too few mitigation measures.

“Apple has promoted itself as one of the leading companies, to responsibly deal with conflict minerals. I think they’re very much aware of the way they source the minerals from DRC as well as the smuggling that takes place,” Kopp said.

Apple did not respond to Al Jazeera’s interview request.

How should companies source minerals in the DRC?

The OECD established a five-step framework for companies on approaches to conflict minerals in 2016.

The guidelines include establishing a strong company management system with transparency over the mineral supply chain; assessing risks in mineral supply chains and designing a strategy to address these risks such as temporarily suspending the trade of the mineral; involving third parties to audit supply chains; and publicly reporting on the supply chain in annual reports.

In the US, the Dodd-Frank Act of the Securities and Exchange Commission also requires companies to file a specialised disclosure report if “they manufacture, or contract to have manufactured, products that contain conflict minerals necessary to those products’ functionality or production and file an additional conflict minerals report”.

Kopp added that authorities in the DRC can do more by enforcing laws to prevent the smuggling of minerals.

Further, he said, “the international community should put pressure on Rwanda which allegedly back rebel groups like M23, to stop being involved in the conflict in DRC and control the borders by also looking into how minerals are traded”.

CNN —

More than 170 inmates on death row were flown from Congo’s capital to a high-security prison in the north where they will be executed, Congolese authorities said.

Seventy of the convicts were transported on Sunday, Congolese Minister of Justice Constant Mutamba said, adding to 102 other prisoners who have already been sent to Angenga prison in the northern Mongala province.

The men have been convicted of armed robbery and are locally known as “Kulunas” or “urban bandits.” They’re aged between 18 and 35, Mutamba said in a statement. He did not say when the executions would take place.

Some have welcomed the measure as a means of restoring order and security in the cities, while others are concerned about the risks of abuse and human rights violations.

“We welcome this decision by the minister because it will help put an end to urban crime. From 8 p.m. onwards, you can’t move around freely because you’re afraid of running into a Kuluna,” said Fiston Kakule, a resident of the eastern city of Goma.

Espoir Muhinuka, a human rights activist, warned of the possibility of extrajudicial executions and called for a strict respect for judicial procedures and fundamental guarantees. He fears that political pressure could lead to unjust convictions and arbitrary executions.

“The situation in the DRC is complex and requires a multidimensional approach. The fight against urban gangs must go hand in hand with efforts to combat poverty, unemployment and social exclusion, which are often contributing factors to crime,” he said.

Congo abolished the death sentence in 1981, but it was reinstated in 2006. The last execution took place in 2003.

In March 2024, the Congolese government announced the resumption of capital punishment in cases of treason by military personnel.In May, eight soldiers were sentenced to death, and in July, 25 soldiers were convicted of similar offences. None is known to have been executed.

Correction: This story has been updated to correct that none of those on death row has yet been executed, as was previously reported by AP.

Title: Foreign fighters defend DR Congo from M23 rebels

Retired European military officers are protecting resource-rich North Kivu province from falling to Rwandan-backed M23 rebels. The job is well paid but soldiers face a well-armed adversary.

Colonel Romuald served in the French army for 36 years. The paratrooper was previously deployed in Mali, Senegal, Togo, Afghanistan and Kosovo. He could be enjoying his pension at home as a veteran, but instead, he is fighting in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

The retired colonel is in charge of a delicate mission in Goma, the capital of the mineral-rich North Kivu province. For that reason, Romuald does not want his family name to be published. He heads a 20-member team at the Bulgarian private security company, Agemira.

This advises the Congolese army on how to combat the rebel M23 militia and bring order to its ranks. The company also maintains aircraft and drones, delivers some of the supplies to the soldiers and facilitates arms deals.

Former comrades reunited

Most of Romuald's employees are retired comrades from the French army. The Congolese government hired the services of Agemira two years ago.

A year earlier, M23 had once again taken up arms. According to United Nations experts, the rebel group is supported by neighboring Rwanda with up to 4,000 soldiers and weapons. The M23 occupies large parts of the fertile and resource-rich province of North Kivu.

In addition to Agemira, President Felix Tshisekedi's administration has also hired the Romanian military company "Romanii care au activat in legiunea franceza" (RALF), which has around 800 fighters.

Many of them have served in the French Foreign Legion. They come from Romania and Belarus. The RALF soldiers form a defensive ring around Goma and the strategically important town of Sake. They call themselves "Romeos."

Fighting for a "noble" cause

Agemira and RALF see themselves as a team. "We are fighting for a noble cause," Romuald told DW.

For him, it is a clear case: Rwanda is occupying DR Congo in violation of international law, stealing its raw materials — for example, from the coltan mine in Rubaya, around 50 kilometers (31 miles) west of Goma — and forcing millions of people to flee.

"I told my wife that I wouldn't return until the refugees could go home," Romuald said.

In February, he confidently announced that the [M23] occupation would be over by the end of 2024.

But now, shortly before the end of the year, fighting is still raging, even though there has officially been a ceasefire since August. Diplomatic negotiations between the DR Congo and Rwanda have so far failed to bring peace.

Romuald admits that he was too optimistic. He cites the Rwandan army's technical superiority and better discipline as the reason why the Congolese military is losing ground.

Discipline is something the Congolese side needs to work on. A few months ago, numerous RALF fighters left the country because the Congolese government had not paid their wages on time.

While changing planes at the airport in Addis Ababa, they were still mocking how everything in Congo is pole pole. That's Kiswahili for slow. However, Romuald said the problem has now been resolved.

Higher wages than the Congolese soldiers

According to the retired colonel, the foreigners' pay ranges from $5,000 to 6,000 (€4,700 to 5,600) per month, depending on their rank.

"That's many times more than the few hundred dollars Congolese soldiers earn," Onesphore Sematumba, a Congolese analyst at the International Crisis Group in Nairobi, said. He considers the unequal treatment of local and foreign soldiers to be "a bit racist."

The foreign officers stay in hotels or villas and drive around in new army vehicles, while the Congolese soldiers have to walk, he noted. That kind of thing stirs up jealousy. An Agemira security official also admitted to this while enjoying the evening in a restaurant on Lake Kivu.

Sematumba credits the mercenaries for defending Goma and Sake until now. But he noted that they cannot stop the advance of the M23 in the rural province. "These highly paid people are not really making a difference."

Sematumba also alluded to the fact that, in addition to the Congolese army and mercenaries, the UN peacekeeping force Monusco, soldiers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), units from Burundi and militant vigilantes are also involved in the ongoing conflict in Congo. Troops from the East African Community were also temporarily deployed.

'Not in it for the money'

Romuald claims that the Europeans are not in the DR Congo for the money. "It's my job and it's an adventure," he explained.

Romuald sees himself primarily as a consultant. "We are not mercenaries," he said. The Agemira employees don't even carry weapons. The RALF military may have guns but would only fight defensively if Goma or Sake were attacked.

Mercenarism is a criminal offense in Europe. Romuald said that the secret services in France and Romania sometimes question the Agemira and RALF military officers when they are on home leave. "As soon as we start behaving like mercenaries, they will arrest us."

The business practices of many private security companies are not transparent. Human Rights Watch accuses Africa Corps (formerly Wagner Group) from Russia and Academi (formerly Blackwater) from the US of crimes. "They wipe out entire villages," Romuald said.

So far, human rights activists in Goma have had no evidence that Agemira or RALF are committing crimes or doing business with raw materials. "The context is different to Wagner," Sematumba explained.

The mercenaries in Congo are not at the front line or in the mining regions. "They have no opportunity to equate rebels with civilians and kill them," he added.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame has called on Congolese authorities to open negotiations with the M23 rebel group, which has recently seized several key towns in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The group’s continued territorial advances are exacerbating an already volatile situation in a region that borders Rwanda.

M23, one of the most prominent armed groups operating in the region, is among over 100 militia factions vying for control in eastern Congo, an area rich in valuable minerals. Last year, the fighting displaced over a million people, underscoring the devastating humanitarian impact of the ongoing conflict.

Speaking on the current situation, Kagame emphasised the need for the DRC government to take responsibility for its internal challenges. "If the DRC government is not encouraged to take its own responsibility for its people and its country and everybody joins them to blame others for their problems, how do you expect Congo to address these problems that affect all of us?" he said.

The M23 rebel group has made significant territorial gains in recent weeks, capturing the towns of Katale and Masisi. The latter is located just 80 kilometres from Goma, the regional capital of North Kivu province. This expansion by M23 has sparked increasing tensions in the region.

In a detailed explanation, Kagame pointed out the historical roots of the M23 group, noting that many of its leaders and fighters originated from Uganda, where they had sought refuge during previous conflicts in 2012 and 2013. "These leaders of M23 and the majority of their fighters came from Uganda where they had been as refugees who fled the problems of 2012/2013 when these people [rebels] moved to Uganda and others came here," he said.

The Rwandan president also expressed confusion over how the conflict, initially sparked by Uganda-based rebels, has come to be framed as Rwanda’s issue. “The fighting was started by the main group that was in and from Uganda. So how did it become Rwanda's problem? Honestly! What is the basis and for how long do we explain this? Up to what point?" Kagame questioned.

Despite Kagame’s calls for dialogue, the DRC government has consistently accused Rwanda of backing the M23 rebels, a claim Rwanda denies. The Congolese government has also rejected Kagame's suggestion to engage in talks with the group, further complicating efforts toward peace.

In Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province, a significant citizen march took place on Wednesday, orchestrated by the civil society organization Forces Vives.

Thousands of locals took to the streets to express their concerns about the troubling advance of M23 rebels moving into South Kivu through the border town of Minova.

Maître Nene Bintu, the leader of Civil Society South Kivu, expressed grave concerns against the government, stating that, "Congolese are being killed like flies, with millions of internally displaced people, accompanied by numerous humanitarian crises and their consequences. The Kigali regime has clearly turned its back on the Luanda process, boycotting the meeting on December 15, 2024, which you attended alone."

Brandishing placards and chanting slogans, demonstrators also condemned the unlawful extraction of minerals, a persistent problem in the area.

South Kivu, abundant in natural resources has suffered for years from organized plundering by Chinese capital firms, which support both local and global networks.

Fadhili Mubole, a resident of Bukavu, expressed concern about the illegal mining of minerals in the Mwenga territory by Chinese nationals.

"I abandoned everything to take to the streets," he said. "We are exhausted from witnessing the plundering of our resources, yet there are no roads or infrastructure being built. Every day, people in our community suffer from hunger, and we must speak out against this injustice."

In the midst of ongoing tensions in eastern DRC, this protest highlights the determination of the South Kivu population to take a stand against insecurity and the unlawful exploitation of their resources.

The spotlight is now on the authorities, urging them to deliver tangible solutions to these pressing challenges that threaten the region's peace and development.

Bernard Maheshe Byamungu, one of the M23 leaders who has been sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council for rights abuses, stood in front of the South Kivu governor’s office in Bukavu and told residents they have been living in a “jungle."

“We are going to clean up the disorder left over from the old regime,” Byamungu said, as some in the small crowd of young men cheered the rebels on to “go all the way to Kinshasa," Congo's capital, nearly 1,000 miles away.

Congo's communications ministry in a statement on social media acknowledged for the first time that Bukavu had been “occupied” and said the national government was “doing everything possible to restore order and territorial integrity” in the region.

One Bukavu resident, Blaise Byamungu, said the rebels marched into the city that had been “abandoned by all the authorities and without any loyalist force."

“Is the government waiting for them to take over other towns to take action? It’s cowardice,” Byamungu added.

Fears of regional escalation

Unlike in 2012, when the M23 briefly seized Goma and withdrew after international pressure, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power.

The fighting in Congo has connections with a decades-long ethnic conflict. The M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group.

Rwanda says the militia group is “fully integrated” into the Congolese military, which denies it.

But the new face of the M23 in the region — Corneille Nangaa — is not Tutsi, giving the group “a new, more diverse, Congolese face, as M23 has always been seen as a Rwanda-backed armed group defending Tutsi minorities,” according to Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol.

Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi, whose government on Saturday asserted that Bukavu remained under its control, has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict.

Congo's forces were being supported in Goma by troops from South Africa and in Bukavu by troops from Burundi. But Burundi's president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest on social media his country would not retaliate in the fighting.

The conflict was high on the African Union summit's agenda in Ethiopia over the weekend, with U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres warning it risked spiraling into a regional conflagration.

Still, African leaders and the international community have been reluctant to take decisive action against M23 or Rwanda, which has one of Africa's most powerful militaries. Most continue to call for a ceasefire and a dialogue between Congo and the rebels.

GOMA, Congo (AP) — Congo’s government on Tuesday described the unilateral ceasefire declared by Rwanda-backed rebels in eastern Congo as “false communication,” while the United Nations noted reports of heavy fighting with Congolese forces in the region.

The M23 rebels on Monday announced the ceasefire on humanitarian grounds after pleas for the safe passage of aid and hundreds of thousands of displaced people.

But “all we are waiting for is the withdrawal of the M23,” Congo’s government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya told journalists.

The M23 last week seized control of Goma, a city of 2 million people at the heart of a region home to trillions of dollars in mineral wealth. It remains under rebel control.

The M23 had been reported to be gaining ground in other areas of eastern Congo and advancing on another provincial capital, Bukavu, in South Kivu.

On Tuesday, U.N, spokesman Stephane Dujarric told journalists they had reports of heavy fighting in South Kivu, though “we don’t have any reports of the M23 moving closer to Bukavu.”

The M23 rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts. That’s far more than in 2012, when they briefly captured Goma then withdrew after international pressure. The M23 are the most potent of the more than 100 armed groups active in Congo’s east, which holds vast deposits critical to much of the world’s technology.

Congo’s government has said it is open to talks to resolve the conflict, but that dialogue must occur within the context of previous peace agreements. Rwanda and the rebels have accused Congo of defaulting on previous agreements.

Regional leaders are meeting Friday and Saturday in Tanzania to discuss the conflict.

Also Tuesday, Congo’s interior minister, Jacquemain Shabani, said the death toll in last week’s fighting had reached 2,000, asserting that bodies had been put into one or more mass graves. Shabani called them “victims of massacres perpetrated by the Rwandan occupation army.”

There was no immediate Rwanda comment.

On Monday, the U.N. health agency said at least 900 people had been killed in the fighting in Goma between the rebels and Congolese forces.

Residents continued to bury bodies.

“I just saw the conditions in which our Congolese brothers were buried, our children who were shot during the events in Goma,” Elisha Dunia, the father of one victim, told The Associated Press at a cemetery in the city. “We are heartbroken, and we ask for peace to return to our country.”

Debors Zuzu, also at the cemetery, said he lost three family members, two in a bomb explosion while another was shot. He said he was devastated.

“Our biggest plea is for the leaders to ensure that the war ends because war has no value. We want peace in Goma,” Zuzu said. “If everyone dies, I don’t know who the leaders will govern.”

The U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Congo, Bruno Lemarquis, called for the urgent reopening of the airport in Goma, calling it “a lifeline” for the evacuation of wounded people and the delivery of aid.

RwandAir suspended its flights to DR Congo in May 2022, after the Congolese government alleged that Rwanda was supporting M23 rebels.

Rwanda dismisses the allegations, saying DR Congo uses it as a scapegoat for its internal governance failures, such as the decades-long persecution of Congolese Tutsi communities, for whom the M23 rebels fight.

Who's pulling the strings in the DR Congo crisis?

8 February 2025 Share Save Barbara Plett Usher Africa correspondent Share Save

AFP The Rwandan-backed M23 group has said they want to liberate DR Congo

The seizure by M23 rebels of vast tracts of land in the mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has triggered a humanitarian and diplomatic crisis, involving several neighbouring countries. An alarming number of African armies already have troops deployed in the conflict zone, which has a long history of outside interference. The DR Congo is so vast - two-thirds the size of Western Europe - that it is a member of both the East and Southern African blocs. The two regional groupings are joining forces to hold an emergency summit on Saturday to try and end the fighting. So, who are the main players and what do they want?

First and foremost is the Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi. He wants to regain territory lost to the rebels, including the largest eastern town of Goma, and to prevent them from seizing more. He blames Rwandan leader Paul Kagame for backing the M23 with weapons and troops, accusing Kigali of invading Congolese territory with the aim of looting the country's mineral wealth and orchestrating regime change. The case that Rwanda is supporting the M23 offensive is based on evidence presented in a UN report and broadly accepted by many African and Western governments, who have demanded that Kagame withdraw his forces. However, to Tshisikedi's frustration, none have matched their rhetoric with action and responded to Kinshasa's calls for sanctions and other tough measures. The Congolese leader is also worried about keeping his seat. "I think the political survival of his government is at stake," said Jason Stearns, a former UN investigator in DR Congo and currently a professor at Simon Fraser University. There is concern that the M23 campaign might embolden internal opposition forces or trigger a coup in his army, which has a reputation for being fragmented and undermined by corruption.

Rwanda - 'The elusive player'

Reuters Rwanda's President Paul Kagame says he is fighting genocidal militias

In this conflict, Rwanda's long-time leader Kagame is the centre of attention, but he's practised at deflecting it. He has a long history of military intervention inside DR Congo linked to the aftermath of the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Rwanda does not admit to providing military support to the M23, but repeatedly insists it will do anything necessary to defend itself. Kagame maintains that Rwanda's priority is to destroy an armed group formed by the Hutu genocide perpetrators, who massacred Rwandan Tutsis and then fled to what is now eastern DR Congo. He has accused DR Congo's army of joining forces with them and others to not only slaughter Congolese Tutsis - who the M23 claims to be fighting to protect - but to threaten Rwanda. At a diplomatic level, Rwanda wants confirmation of its narrative – that the conflict is a Congolese problem, and Kigali is simply defending its borders against the spill-over of a civil war. It's demanding that Kinshasa negotiate directly with the M23, which it refuses to do. But what it's really after, said Mr Stearns, is "to maintain a sphere of influence in the eastern DR Congo".

AFP Friends and relatives watch as those who were killed when the M23 captured Goma are buried in fresh graves

Rwanda has economic as well as security interests. Kigali denies UN evidence that it smuggles vast amounts of gold and other metals out of eastern DR Congo and sells them as its own. But access to DR Congo's mineral wealth has been a driver of conflict in the region for decades. There are others this time around, not least the personal animosity between Kagame and Tshisekedi. "Kagame wants to teach Tshisekedi a lesson about who's the strong guy on the block," said Richard Moncrieff, who monitors Africa's Great Lakes region for the International Crisis Group (ICG). The Rwandans are "just going to keep fighting until he makes concessions and…gives them fairly free rein in [the eastern province of] North Kivu," he added. Who is Rwanda's leader Paul Kagame?

Burundi - 'The watchful neighbour'

Getty Images Burundi's President Evariste Ndayishimiye has had a tense relationship with Rwanda's Kagame for years

Rwanda sees Burundi's army as another security threat in eastern DR Congo. The nation that borders both Rwanda and DR Congo has had thousands of soldiers there for years. They went to hunt down Burundian rebels but are now supporting Kinshasa's army in battles against the M23. Relations between Rwanda and Burundi are hostile. The two countries have a similar ethnic make-up but unlike Rwanda, the majority Hutus are in power in Burundi. Both countries have accused each other of trying to overthrow their respective governments. Burundi's President Evariste Ndayishimiye has posted a strongly-worded warning on social media. "If Rwanda continues to make conquests," he wrote, "I know that war will even arrive in Burundi… One day he [Kagame] wants to come to Burundi - we're not going to accept that. The war will spread." The threat would increase if the M23 continues its advance from Goma into the province of South Kivu closer to Burundi's border, which is where its forces are stationed. "What Burundi is seeking here is regime survival," said Mr Stearns. "Burundi is worried that if Rwandan troops… extend their influence into South Kivu that could destabilize the government in Bujumbura. What's at stake here is stopping this rebellion before it gets too close to home." Some fear a repeat of the two wars that engulfed the region in the late 1990s, which drew in nine different countries and reportedly led to millions of deaths. This time, direct clashes between the two armies could extend the DR Congo's conflict beyond its borders. LISTEN: What will it take to end tensions between Rwanda and Burundi?

Uganda - 'Playing it both ways'

Uganda is not directly involved, but it also has troops in eastern DR Congo. They are helping the Congolese government with a different security threat – hunting down militants with Ugandan origins who are connected to the Islamic State group. But Uganda's role is confusing – it's working with the Congolese, while also allegedly providing at least complicit support to the M23. UN experts report that it has allowed them to use Ugandan territory as a rear base and supply route. Kampala strongly denies that. But it has responded to the M23 offensive by putting its troops in a "forward defensive posture," to prevent other armed groups from exploiting the crisis, it has said. Local residents have reported seeing Ugandan soldiers moving towards the conflict zone, heightening fears of a regional escalation. Like Rwanda, Uganda has entered eastern DR Congo in the past claiming to be protecting its borders. But it's also accused of looting natural resources, especially gold. Analysts expect it to safeguard its economic interests while keeping an eye on the Rwandans. "It's very clear that Uganda wants to retain its own influence in eastern DR Congo and not be pushed out by its rival in Rwanda," says the ICG's Mr Moncrieff. Who is Uganda's longtime leader Yoweri Museveni?

South Africa - 'The peacekeeper taking sides'

South Africa has contributed most of the troops to a Southern African regional force fighting alongside the Congolese army and has suffered heavy losses. But it's also been thrust into the headlines because of an astonishingly vitriolic exchange between Kigali and Johannesburg. The South Africans blamed the deaths of 14 of their soldiers on the Rwandan Defense Forces, which President Cyril Ramaphosa disparagingly referred to as the "RDF militia."

AFP Congolese people in South Africa have been protesting against the conflict in their country for decades

His defence minister claimed he'd warned Kagame that any further shooting would be taken as a declaration of war. This infuriated the Rwandan president, who said that the account of their conversation was a "lie" and called the South Africans a "belligerent" force that must leave the DR Congo. This is the sharpest end of a broad division between the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (Sadc). The EAC supports Rwanda's call for direct talks between Kinshasa and the M23. While Sadc condemns RDF attacks on its soldiers, including Tanzanian and Malawian troops, and has reaffirmed their commitment to DR Congo's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

Congo wars: Mai-Mai heydays

Present-day Mai-Mai groups have their immediate roots among the armed groups that appeared in the early 1990s. This period was marked by a fledgling democratisation process that triggered the political manipulation of conflicts around land, local authority and access to resources in the east of the country then known as Zaire. Many of these conflicts grew out of the colonial period, when the colonisers granted certain groups customary chiefdoms but excluded others, and organised the mass migration of Rwandans to Congo to work on plantations and in mines.

These processes left a legacy of disputes that were often expressed in identity-based terms, pitting populations identifying themselves as ‘indigenous’ (or ‘autochthonous’) against speakers of Kinyarwanda (Rwandophones, encompassing Hutu and Tutsi), who were labelled ‘foreigners’. Within this context, armed groups were seen to defend the land and rights of particular (ethnic) communities, and were closely linked to the leaders of those communities.

The mobilisation of these groups drastically increased during the First (1996–97) but particularly in the Second (1998–2003) Congo War, both of which were unleashed by the invasion of insurgencies supported by the Rwandan government. During the Second War, the Rwanda-backed Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) managed to occupy large swathes of the east. Based in remote rural areas, Mai-Mai groups waged a guerrilla war against the RCD, whose leadership was dominated by Congolese Rwandophones.

Given the strong dislike for the RCD among large parts of the population, Mai-Mai groups drew massive popular support, portraying themselves not so much as an armed group but as a ‘popular movement’ engaging in self-defence. As Kapopo, former commander of a Mai-Mai group in Itombwe said: ‘The Mai-Mai, it’s not only us. It’s everyone, it’s every patriot who defends the Congo. It’s not a movement linked to a person, it’s the state of mind of every patriot, of those who defend their country and do not want aggression and the pillage of natural resources’ (interview, Bukavu, 27 March 2011).

Despite this popular ethos, Mai-Mai groups became increasingly disconnected from the communities they had emerged from and started to pursue their own agendas. Several groups liaised with bigger politico-military movements, which sometimes also provided military training. Many became caught up in competition over access to natural resources, such as gold, coltan and timber. Being based in the west and having no troops in the rebel-occupied east, the Congolese government also used Mai-Mai groups as proxies to fight the RCD, providing them with arms and ammunition. This diversification of sources of income and support made Mai-Mai groups less dependent on and accountable to local communities, contributing to a rise in abuses against the very civilians they claimed to defend.

Burundian troops in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo are getting roped into the murk of M23 rebels who accuse the troops of working with “enemies.”

The accusations emerged in a statement last week by M23, who say Burundians are collaborating with armed groups that formed out of remnants of the genocidaires in Rwanda who had fled into the DRC after the Genocide against the Tutsi in 1994.

The accusations revisit an age-old tale of how Rwandan and Burundian armed groups have operated inside the Congo but could ruin the warming ties between Rwanda and Burundi.

The M23 rebels had been fighting with the Congolese army (FARDC) as well as an allied self-defence group known as Wazalendo. But roping in Burundi means the East African Community Regional Force (EACRF) in which Burundian troops now serve may be in for a challenge.

“The DRC government coalition forces including FARDC, FDLR, mercenaries, militias and Burundi national defence forces have used the areas handed over to EAC to intensify their attack against the civilian population, burning villages, targeted killings, looting and destruction of properties", reads the M23 statement issued on Tuesday.

Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23 spokesperson added "The M23 is greatly concerned about the implication of an EAC chair state and ICGLR state member Burundi in violation of the ceasefire, which implies a planned conspiracy.”

Burundi refuted the assertions.

"These slanderous assertions are a serious insult to the professionalism with which our troops carry out their missions wherever they are deployed. The FDNB (Burundi National Defence Force) unequivocally denies these malicious remarks made for ulterior motives. The Burundian military has never collaborated with any armed group and never intends to do so,” said Col Floribert Biyereke, spokesman for the Burundian army.

He said the accusations were made by ill-intentioned people.

“Despite the efforts made by the Burundian troops in the DRC, it is deplorable that certain ill-intentioned people are making unfounded accusations that the Burundian troops which are deployed in North Kivu are collaborating with armed groups, training them and offering them weapons.”

Eastern DRC has over 100 armed groups, some splinters of initial groups. But there are foreign fighters too. The FDLR (known in French as Forces démocratiques de libération du Rwanda) for example, is said to be an offshoot of Rwandan genocidaires. The M23 are of Rwandan ethnic communities in the DRC, which has been subject to perennial tensions between Rwanda and the DR Congo.

An earlier directive by regional leaders under the Luanda Process had agreed that all foreign fighters leave DRC and M23 surrender conquered territory in exchange for ceasefire and cantonment.

Most of that has been violated. Kinshasa accuses Kigali of fomenting M23 violence while Kigali says DRC has refused to deal with the FDLR problem. Both sides deny charges levelled against them.

On November 9, the Burundian army spokesman issued a new statement claiming that the Burundian contingent had twice found itself in a conflict situation. "On October 21, the convoy of the Burundian contingent of the East African Community Regional Force carrying supplies to Kitchanga and Mweso (North Kivu) was refused passage by the M23, which blocked the road leading to these two towns.

“The same thing happened again on October 30, when a convoy of the same contingent heading for the same positions was blocked en route by the same M23 elements. The command of the East African Community Regional Force was called in to resolve the matter, but was unable to bring the M23 to its senses.”

Colonel Biyereke warned of “necessary measures” to secure their position.

Relations between Rwanda and Burundi, initially on the rocks, have been normalising recently, as seen through top-rank visits between them.

Diplomatic ties between Rwanda and Burundi had deteriorated from April 2015, following a crisis sparked by protests against the third term of office bid by the late Pierre Nkurunziza. Back then, Burundi accused Rwanda of harbouring its opponents, including the coup plotters who attempted a coup in May 2015. Kigali accused Bujumbura of collaborating with the FDLR rebels.

How far will this potentially explosive situation go? The DRC has said the stay in Congo by the EACRF force should not be renewed on December 8, when its mandate expires.

Congolese authorities have always been satisfied with the Burundian troops. In May, President Félix Tshisekedi stated that of all the East African contingents deployed in the DRC, only the Burundian troops were the ones who met expectations.

“The Burundian army is the only one operating against armed groups as part of the force of East African countries deployed since the end of 2022 in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo", Tshisekedi said, adding that “There is a kind of collaboration between the EAC force and the M23 terrorists. The proof of this is the intervention of the Burundians when the M23 terrorists began illegally levying taxes in the territories they occupied.”

Burundi and the DRC have also stepped up their military cooperation. A new bilateral military agreement was signed between Tshisekedi and Evariste Ndayishimiye in August in Kinshasa.

This agreement had been preceded by another defence agreement signed in March in Bujumbura between Gilbert Kabanda, then Minister for Defence, and his counterpart Alain Tribert Mutabazi. The Burundian army is currently deployed in both Kivus (North and South) to track down local rebels and those of Burundian origin.

The deadly march by Rwanda-backed rebels across eastern Congo could widen into a regional conflict drawing in even more countries, analysts warn, and the two nations most involved in the mineral-rich area might be the key to stopping the violence.

The M23 rebels ' capture of the city of Goma last month and their reported advance on another provincial capital have drawn in concerned countries from east and southern Africa. A joint meeting of leaders from those regions over the weekend offered no strong proposals for ending the fighting beyond urging talks and an immediate ceasefire.

Notably, they didn’t call for the rebels to withdraw from Goma.

At the summit’s conclusion, Congo issued a statement welcoming its “foundations for a collective approach” to securing peace. But there are concerns that long-shifting alliances in the region also could lead to a collective collapse.

Asking neighbors for help

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi had sought the help of allies in the region and beyond when the M23 rebels resurfaced at the end of 2021.

Troops from Burundi, with its own tense relations with Rwanda, were sent to fight alongside Congolese forces. Troops from Tanzania, which hosted the weekend summit, were deployed in Congo under the banner of a regional bloc. And Uganda, on poor terms with Rwanda, had already deployed hundreds of troops to fight a different rebel group in eastern Congo.

For Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, it was “like juggling a polygamous marriage” as he maneuvered to protect his vast country's territorial integrity, said Murithi Mutiga, Africa director at the International Crisis Group.

“Rwanda felt excluded while Burundi and Uganda were welcome” in eastern Congo, Mutiga said. “Rwanda decided to assert itself.”

A surge in fighting

Congolese authorities see the M23 rebels as a Rwandan proxy army driven to illegally exploit eastern Congo’s vast mineral resources, whose value is estimated in the trillions of dollars.

The rebels are backed by some 4,000 troops from Rwanda, according to evidence collected by United Nations experts.

The M23 rebellion stems partly from Rwanda’s decades-long concern that other rebels — ethnic Hutus opposed to Rwanda's government and accused of participating in Rwanda's 1994 genocide — have been allowed to operate in largely lawless parts of eastern Congo.

Rwanda's longtime President Paul Kagame accuses Tshisekedi of overlooking the concerns of Congo's ethnic Tutsis after hundreds of thousands of Tutsis were killed in the genocide.

The M23's ranks contain many Congolese Tutsis.

The rebels’ next big target is Bukavu, capital of South Kivu province, and they have vowed to go all the way to Kinshasa, Congo's capital, some 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) away.

Risk of more armed actors

Eastern Congo in recent decades has been the setting for a conflict that has caused the highest death toll since World War II.

Its last major regional upheaval broke out in 1998 as Congo's then-President Laurent Kabila invited forces from countries including Zimbabwe and Angola to protect him from Rwanda-backed rebels who sought to overthrow him. Uganda and Rwanda, which had helped Kabila seize power by force the previous year before feeling alienated by him, fought mostly on the same side.

Now, analysts say both Rwanda and Uganda are key again.

The risk of regional escalation this time is "big,” especially with both Kagame and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni still eager for influence in eastern Congo, said Godber Tumushabe, an analyst with the Kampala-based Great Lakes Institute for Strategic Studies think tank.

Both leaders are crucial to any effort to stop the fighting, Tumushabe said: “They will not allow a settlement” that doesn’t look after their interests in eastern Congo. But they have their own friction as Rwanda suspects Uganda of backing yet another group of rebels opposed to Kagame.

Burundi is also heavily involved. A year ago, Burundi closed border crossings with Rwanda and severed diplomatic ties over allegations that Rwanda’s government was supporting rebels in eastern Congo who oppose Burundian President Evariste Ndayishimiye. By then, Burundian troops were deployed there to fight alongside Congolese troops.

Ndayishimiye has accused Kagame of reckless warmongering. He told a gathering of diplomats in Bujumbura last month that “if Rwanda continues to conquer the territory of another country, I know well that it will even arrive in Burundi.” He warned that the “war will take a regional dimension.”

Efforts at peace

With Rwanda and Congo each "drawing a line in the sand,” diplomacy faces a great challenge, said Mutiga with the International Crisis Group.

Efforts at peace have largely sputtered, including the yearslong presence of a U.N. peacekeeping force in eastern Congo that has been under Congolese government pressure to leave.

Other fighters on the ground have included mercenaries for Congo, including many Romanians, and troops from the southern Africa regional bloc that Rwanda's president has alleged — without providing evidence — are not peacekeepers but collaborators with Congo’s army.

Congo's president has refused to engage with the M23. And he did not attend the weekend summit in Tanzania, instead monitoring it virtually. At its conclusion, his government welcomed the collective effort to stop the fighting but disputed Rwanda's attempted explanation for M23's resurgence.

"The current crisis is, above all, an attack on (Congo's) sovereignty and security, and not an ethnic question,” Congo's statement said.

The next steps in trying to resolve the conflict are unclear.

The sounds of hammering and the clattering of corrugated metal roofs resonated throughout Goma’s Bulengo camp for internally displaced persons on Tuesday as residents began taking apart the shelters they had occupied for years.

They reported that M23 rebels, allegedly supported by Rwanda, passed through the camp on Saturday and ordered them to leave within three days.

Just weeks prior, M23 had seized control of Goma, a key city in eastern Congo that has long been a haven for those escaping ongoing violence.

Camps in and around Goma housed hundreds of thousands of displaced individuals, many of whom have fled conflict multiple times throughout their lives.

Sibomana Safari, a former resident of the Bulengo camp, walked through the area, burdened by the weight of his belongings on his back.

“I’m not sure how we will survive. I have children, and it’s shocking to be told to leave with nothing to provide for them,” he expressed.

After taking over Goma, M23 leaders announced plans to reopen schools and restore the disrupted water supply.

As bodies from the fighting accumulated in the streets, with Red Cross workers struggling to manage the situation, residents were instructed to resume their normal activities.

However, the future for those already in a vulnerable position remained uncertain.

Prior to the M23 takeover of Goma, the eastern provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu already hosted over 4 million displaced individuals.

Vincent Bauma, who lived in Goma’s Lushagala camp, took down his modest shelter with just a hammer on Tuesday morning while other residents watched.

“The authorities have told us to tear down our small homes and return, but we have no idea how we will get back. There is still no peace,” he stated.

Oonagh Curry, an emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders in Goma, expressed concern over the rapid movement of people leaving the camps and questioned where they would go.

“It is crucial to remember that a sudden population shift can worsen the ongoing humanitarian crisis,” she stated.

Kwimana Sifa appeared worn out as she dismantled her shelter bit by bit.

“Our homes have been obliterated by bombs, and we have no place to turn,” she expressed.

“It’s preferable to leave us here. Even though we lack food, at least we have some shelter,” Sifa continued.

GOMA, Congo (AP) — Militia fighters killed at least 55 civilians in an attack on a cluster of villages and a camp for displaced people in northeastern Congo, local authorities said Tuesday.

Violence has surged across eastern Congo, where conflict has raged for decades. More than 120 armed groups are fighting in the region, most for land and control of mines with valuable minerals, while some are trying to protect their communities.

Armed men from the CODECO militia attacked the Djaiba group of villages, which is also home to a camp for the displaced, in the province of Ituri Monday night, Antoinnette Nzale, the leader of the camp, told The Associated Press. She said 55 civilians died but added that the death toll is likely higher, as bodies continue to be retrieved from the burned down houses.

The Cooperative for the Development of Congo, or CODECO, is a loose association of militia groups mainly from the ethnic Lendu farming community. The group’s attacks killed nearly 1,800 people and wounded more than 500 in the four years through 2022, according to the African Center for the Study and Research on Terrorism.

The United Nations has said some of the attacks could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.

“Almost the entire village was attacked,” Nzale said, adding that the U.N. peacekeeping force known as MONUSCO and Congolese government troops intervened but were overwhelmed by the more numerous attackers.

Jean Richard Lenga, chief of Bahema Badjere district, where the villages are located, confirmed the attack, adding that at least 38 people were killed. He also said the death toll is likely higher as bodies continue to be retrieved.

Most of the victims were displaced people who were killed with machetes and firearms, Mumbere David, a resident of Djaiba, told the AP over the phone.

In September, CODECO fighters killed at least 20 civilians in Djugu, the same territory that was attacked on Monday night.

The conflict in eastern Congo escalated last month after Rwanda-backed rebels seized Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, which is about 350 kilometers (215 miles) south of Ituri province.

People displaced by conflict live in a temporary camp near Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Kinshasa — There are 25.6 million people who continue to face crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), according to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report. Armed violence, continued conflict and soaring food prices are driving acute food insecurity affecting displaced people and returnees. Despite high levels of hunger, the DRC boasts fertile lands and abundant water resources and possesses the inherent capacity to attain self-sufficiency in food production. However, various factors such as the intensifying conflict in east , the impact of climate change and epidemics, and a lack of investment in rural development prevent the country from attaining food sufficiency.

While overall food insecurity levels in the DRC remain stagnant, the situation in the eastern provinces of Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu has deteriorated. Driven by conflict and continued displacement, 6.2 million people are expected to face crisis or emergency levels of hunger, up from 5.4 million in mid-2024. Due to intense flooding, Tanganyika is now the most food insecure province in DRC.

"The IPC figures speak for themselves. We need to take action and ensure that livelihood support is provided at the appropriate level. FAO is committed to strengthening the resilience of households facing food insecurity through targeted interventions that address the impacts of climate change in the agriculture, fisheries, and livestock sectors," said FAO representative Aristide Ongone Obame.

The conflict in eastern DRC has disrupted vital agriculture production and the growth of essential infrastructure. This is a crisis fueled by shifting armed group dynamics and resource struggles, exacerbated by deep-rooted geopolitical tensions. As a result, more than 6.5million people are now displaced from their homes in the three eastern provinces of Ituri, North Kivu, and South Kivu.

"In 2025 we need to work more on resilience and strengthening the food systems in the DRC to help move families out of hunger," said Peter Musoko, the United Nations World Food Programme's (WFP) Country Director and Representative in the DRC. "In such a fragile context, the cost of inaction is truly unthinkable. Together, we need to work with the government and the humanitarian community to increase resources for this neglected crisis."

Despite needs outpacing available resources, WFP reached 1.95 million people in October 2024 alone. As humanitarian needs continue to grow, WFP faces a critical funding gap of US$ 350 million over the next six months to provide essential food and nutrition assistance to the most vulnerable people.

In 2024 FAO needed US$ 233.9M for its assistance in the DRC. As of end of September FAO has assisted 3.0 million people out of the 3.6 million planned and requires more financial resources to meet the current gap.

Title: Congo's Disease X: Could it be malaria?
Source: Deutsche Welle

An undiagnosed 'Disease X' is spreading in a remote region of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The WHO and AfricaCDC have sent scientists to discover what it is. Can it be treated?

Initial lab analyses suggest the mysterious disease spreading in the Democratic Republic of Congo could be malaria, though authorities still believe more than one infection may be involved in the outbreak.

World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Tuesday confirmed results of the first lab tests of the disease showed the presence of the mosquito-transmitted infection.

"Of the 12 initial samples collected, 10 tested positive for malaria, although it’s possible that more than one disease is involved," he said during a media briefing.

So far, Congo has recorded 416 cases of the undiagnosed disease. Severe cases have been reported among severely malnourished people, including 31 deaths, mostly children.

The spread of the disease is currently concentrated in the Panzi district in Kwango province, located about 700 kilometers (435 miles) from the capital, Kinshasa. Panzi district is remote, with difficult-to-access roads and nearly non-existent health infrastructure.

Health officials say the disease is most likely to be an already-known illness rather than a brand-new one.

"Reports of outbreaks with fatalities crop up somewhere in the world several times a year. Almost all turn out to be an already well-known infection with limited global consequences," said Paul Hunter, an epidemiologist at the University of East Anglia, UK, in a press statement.

What is the likeliest cause of the disease outbreak?

Jake Dunning, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Oxford, UK, said calling the incident a Disease X outbreak could be misleading and counterproductive.

"Disease X should only really be used when there is an infectious disease with epidemic or pandemic potential and a novel pathogen has been identified or is strongly suspected. It would be more appropriate to say that, currently, this is an undiagnosed morbidity and mortality event," Dunning told DW via email.

The disease causes flu-like symptoms of fever, headache, cough and anemia.

That's why the WHO also believes the unidentified disease will most likely be traced back to already known causes.

Based on the symptoms, acute pneumonia, influenza, COVID-19, measles and malaria are being considered as possible causes.

These symptoms are associated with malaria, but other infections that may be causing the illness include measles and mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya.

Africa CDC investigating causes with local authorities, WHO

The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) has deployed a multidisciplinary team of science and health experts to support the WHO and DRC's Ministry of Health's ongoing investigation.

Meanwhile, they are running diagnostic tests and implementing disease control measures on the basis that more than one disease is responsible for the infections.

However, they are likely to face difficulties detecting the cause because of the affected area's remoteness and logistical barriers.

Limited mobile phone and internet coverage across the region have hampered deployment of response teams. It's a two-day drive from the nearest major healthcare hub in Kinshasa due to the rainy season affecting roads.

Why is this disease such a mystery?

Health experts believe the causes of the outbreak are unknown because of limited testing capabilities in the region.

Clinical laboratories in the Panzi district can only test for common pathogens. The detection of rarer pathogens often requires samples to be sent to specialist laboratories. Scientists there use techniques that aren't available in remote areas, such as gene sequencing, to find which pathogens are causing a disease to spread.

For DRC, this might mean samples will be sent abroad for testing, increasing delays.

"The DRC has some great clinicians, scientists, and laboratories, all well versed in outbreaks and emerging infections, but the DRC is a huge country and arguably remains resource-limited and a complex environment," Dunning told DW.

The lack of information about the disease makes it harder for local health authorities to accurately assess the threat they face.

International healthcare teams are investigating so-called transmission dynamics, and actively searching for additional cases, both within health facilities and at the community level.

"It is vital that these cases are investigated promptly so that appropriate treatment and control measures can be implemented," said Hunter.

Deputy governor of Kwango Remy Saki told DW on December 8 that the province had implemented measures to prevent the epidemic from spreading.

The measures include limiting the movement of people and registering the entry and exit of people from surrounding villages, as well as wearing face masks.

M23 rebels continue to gain ground in eastern DRC.

The group who is reportedly backed by Rwanda seized Sunday (Nov. 03) the strategic town of Kamandi Gîte, according to media reports.

Kamandi Gîte is located on the banks of Lake Edward and offer a connexion to the city of Beni.

Local media cited sources on the ground to report that forced displacement were observed in the wake of the town's fall to the hands of the rebels.

M23 rebels faced self-defence fighters known as Wezalendo or patriots who are allied with the DRC's armed forces.

The fresh fighting comes when experts from Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo continue to dialogue within the framework of the Luanda process.

Angola plays the role of a mediator between the neighbours.

A meeting is scheduled on November 16.

Rwanda and DRC have reportedly agreed on a plan which includes the disengagement of military forces and the neutralization of the FDLR, which included in its ranks fighters who carried out the 1994 Rwanda genocide.

As the world prepares to celebrate the New Year 2025, an atmosphere of sadness and uncertainty looms over the city of Goma, in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The conflict that has been ravaging the region for several months has cast a dark shadow over the usual festivities, and the hope for a better future seems to be fading.

The central market of Goma, usually lively and colourful as the New Year approaches, is sad. The stalls are almost empty, the vendors are disappointed, and customers are scarce. The fighting between the Congolese army and the M23 has intensified in recent months, threatening the city of Goma and plunging its residents into fear.

Josephine Kahindo, a mother of four children, shares her difficulty in celebrating in a war-torn environment: “The holidays are here, but we haven’t seen anything. A holiday during the war, a holiday with many problems. We don’t know what our children will eat or wear. We just watch other people pass by, but we don’t know anything about the holidays.”

The impact of the war on the local economy is devastating. Business activities are paralyzed, investments have been frozen, and government tax revenues are plummeting. The loss of earnings is enormous, and this is likely to have dramatic consequences for the region’s development.

Deogracias Bengehya, an economics professor, explains: “These food products are becoming scarce. With the law of supply and demand, the price trend is increasing, and when prices rise, purchasing power deteriorates and decreases. Not only that, but there are also other people who rely on small businesses.”

The hope for lasting peace is the only gift the people of Goma wish to receive for the New Year. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on the M23 and Rwanda to cease hostilities and withdraw their positions in the DRC during a phone conversation with both heads of state.

Despite calls for peace, uncertainty still looms over Goma. The residents are preparing for a New Year marked by fear and scarcity, hoping that 2025 will finally bring peace and stability to their region.

A humanitarian truce is in effect in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo but the situation remains arlarming given the rebels territorial gains.

Updating the Security Council on her mandated activities, the Head of the UN Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO), expressed grave concern Monday (Jul. 08).

“The security situation in Eastern DRC has continued to deteriorate, reaching alarming levels of violence and civilian displacements. I am extremely concerned about the rapid expansion of the Mouvement du 23 mars (M23) in North Kivu and the spill over into South Kivu, despite numerous operations conducted by the FARDC, regularly supported by MONUSCO and SAMIDRC.

Bintou Keita notably highlited the humanitarian catastrophe.

“The DRC today counts 7.3 million displaced people, including 6.9 million in the Eastern provinces alone. International Humanitarian Law violations are impeding humanitarian aid delivery. The growing proximity of the frontlines and the presence of weapons (including heavy artillery) within and around displacement camps and spontaneous sites significantly compromise the security of the displaced and resident populations

After birefing the 15-member organ, the Special Representative of the UN chief spoke to the press and detailed the disengagement plan of the MONUSCO which is set to enter it second phase when possible. The first phase was concluded on June 25th.

“It’s not exactly where we want all of us the things to be, conform to the disengagement plan; So, we will take time to consolidate what has been done in South Kivu, with the understanding that the government is going to continue to increase its capability, particularly the deployment of the security services".

Meanwhile the Permanent Representative of the DRC to the UN, Zenon Ngay Mukongo said, “The Democratic Republic of Congo will defend its territorial integrity, sovereignty, and the security of its populations at all costs while remaining open to a political resolution of the conflict with Rwanda through diplomatic means. However, this path will only be credible if Rwandan troops effectively withdraw from Congolese territory to allow for genuine and constructive dialogue.”

His counterpart Ernest Rwamucyo, Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Rwanda said, “I wish to conclude by expressing, once again, Rwanda’s support for regional initiatives, especially the Nairobi and Luanda Peace Processes. Rwanda strongly appeals to the international community to support these regional efforts which focus on political solutions, including the need for a political dialogue, and the need to permanently address the issue of the FDLR by disarming, demobilizing, and repatriating them to Rwanda.”

A report by a group of UN experts unveiled Monday found that Uganda provides support to M23 rebels who are allegdly backed by Rwanda.

Rebel forces, backed by Rwanda, have seized control of the town of Masisi in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

This marks the second town captured by the M23 group in just two days, in the North Kivu province.

Since 2021, the M23 rebels have taken control of large parts of eastern DR Congo, displacing hundreds of thousands of people in the process.

Efforts to mediate the ongoing conflict have been led by Angola, with talks between Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame. However, those negotiations collapsed last month, leaving the region in a continued state of instability.

The Congolese authorities have not yet commented on the loss of the town.

Masisi, which has a population of about 40,000,is about 80km (50 miles) north of the North Kivu provincial capital Goma, which the M23 briefly occupied in 2012.

Rebels with the M23 group have seized two key towns in eastern Congo as they advance in the volatile region, civil society and a local politician said Monday, as the security and humanitarian crisis deepened.

The rebels over the past week took Katale and Masisi towns, the latter located 80 kilometers (49 miles) west of the regional capital, Goma, and a strategic entry point into the country's interior.

The M23 is one of over 100 armed groups that have been vying for territory in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced.

M23 political spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka claimed responsibility for the capture of Masisi on social media platform X. He asserted that the group is committed to protecting civilians.

Alexis Bahunga, deputy for the Masisi territory, confirmed that Masisi was under the M23's control.

“The humanitarian situation is so catastrophic,” he told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday. “People are scattered in all corners of the territory, in camps.”

The spokesman for the Congolese army, Col. Djike Kaiko, told the AP he was still checking the information.

John Banyene, president of the civil society group Forces Vives du Nord-Kivu, denounced the government’s “lethargy” in the face of the rebel advance.

“It is inconceivable that the government continues to act in this way at a time when we are losing space,” he said.

Bernard Kanyama, a resident of Bweremana village next to Masisi, said he saw people fleeing to other villages.

“We saw even yesterday two people who died when the rebels fired a bomb in Bweremana and several wounded, so we are very worried,” he told the AP.

Congo and the United Nations accuse Rwanda of backing the M23. Rwanda denies it, but in February it acknowledged that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border.

U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo.

In July, Congo signed a ceasefire with the M23, which came into effect in August, but fighting has resumed, with the United States saying it was “gravely concerned” by ceasefire violations by M23 rebels.

A crowd of civilians celebrated the arrival of M23 rebels in Bukavu's city centre with chants and cheers.

It is the second regional capital city in the Democratic Republic of Congo that the rebels have taken since early January, when they launched a lightning-speed offensive on Goma in neighbouring North Kivu.

M23 marched south into Bukavu on Saturday, although conflicting reports initially made it difficult to confirm the extent of its advance.

They seemingly encountered little to no resistance.

Congolese soldiers and allied troops from Burundi had reportedly retreated from Bukavu's military bases on Friday, the same day that M23 took control of a regional airport around 30 kilometres outside of Bukavu.

Reports emerged of sporadic gunfire and the looting of a World Food Programme depot and supermarkets in Bukavu.

Despite the chaotic scenes, most streets of the city were actually deserted for hours as residents hid in their homes from looters and the rebels.

Faced with the growing risk of a regional war, the international community has stepped up its calls for deescalation and a ceasefire.

Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the UN, reiterated during an African Union summit on Saturday to " avoid a regional escalation at all costs."

Fierce battles between Congolese troops and the M23 rebels in eastern DR Congo have intensified regional tensions. Experts say it points to worsening relations between Kigali and Kinshasa.

Intense fighting between the Congolese army and the M23 rebels is exacerbating the security crisis in eastern DR Congo. More than 100,000 civilians have been forced to flee in recent days as the M23 rebel fighters advance towards North Kivu's provincial capital, Goma, bordering Rwanda and Uganda.

The Congolese army and M23 have been fighting for control of Goma and the surrounding area for many years. In November 2012, M23 briefly seized Goma — a strategic city with approximately 1 million people — but the rebels later withdrew from Goma after an agreement with the government brokered by Uganda. The M23 (March 23 Movement) is among over 200 armed rebel groups in the mineral-rich eastern DRC. However, analysts say the M23 is the most significant threat to Congo's sovereignty due to its alleged ties with Rwanda.

M23 serving Rwanda's interests

Congo's multi-faceted conflict has spilled over into the wider Great Lakes region. Kinshasa has long accused neighboring Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebels. The United Nations also blames Kigali for funding, training, and equipping the M23 rebels.

Despite previous denials, Rwanda earlier this week rejected calls by the US for it to withdraw troops and missile systems, saying the military installments are in eastern DRC to defend Rwanda from the FDLR (Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda), an armed rebel group whose members include alleged perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide in which nearly a million Tutsi were killed by Hutu militias. Many of them later fled to Congo to avoid facing justice in Rwanda.

"The M23 group has always served as a vehicle to protect Rwandan interests in eastern Congo," said Kristof Titeca, conflict researcher for Central and East Africa at the University of Antwerp. He told DW that Rwanda has political, security and economic interests in the DRC. "Rwanda sees the FDLR as a major threat to its security," Titeca said. "The Congolese army is collaborating with the FDLR, that angers Kigali."

Congo's gold as a source of revenue for Rwanda

Formal and informal trade between DR Congo and Rwanda is flourishing, especially in gold. "Gold is an important source of foreign currency for Kigali, and much of it comes from eastern Congo," Titeca said.

But it is not just its value that has placed gold at the heart of controversy. It occupies an important place in the geopolitical competition between Uganda, Rwanda, and the Congo, Jason Stearns, director of the Congo Research Group, said in a report.

Before the M23 rebellion even began, Rwanda's largest export was Congolese gold, which rose from 1% in 2014 to 47% in 2020. "In Uganda, we can see a similar trend, culminating in 2021, when gold made up 56% of its exports", Stearns wrote.

According to analyst Titeca, Rwanda considers parts of eastern Congo as part of its sphere of influence. But in November 2021, the Ugandan army sent troops to the eastern DRC in a joint offensive with the Congolese army against the ADF (Allied Democratic Forces) rebels.

Uganda's role in DR Congo

The ADF, historically a Ugandan Muslim-majority rebel coalition, established itself in eastern DRC in 1995 and has operated for years along the border areas of both countries.

Uganda's intervention has further disrupted the fragile regional balance, Titeca says. "This is the main reason for the emergence of the M23 at the end of 2021."

This military rebel group, which consists mainly of ethnic Tutsis, broke away from the Congolese army just over ten years ago. In 2012, the rebels carried out a major offensive and captured Goma.

However, the M23 rebellion was crushed by the army in 2013, and the fighters and their leaders fled to Uganda and Rwanda, Titeca explained.

A negotiated peace agreement — seen as a crucial step towards ending the violence in eastern Congo, including the integration of the M23 into the Congolese army — has not been implemented.

The M23 group accuses the Congolese authorities of failing to combat the Rwandan Hutu rebels who settled in eastern Congo after the Rwandan genocide in 1994, as well as other armed groups that pose a threat to Congolese Tutsis.

"The resurgence of the M23 must be seen as a reflection of the deteriorating relations between Kinshasa and Kigali," Titeca added.

Efforts to find lasting peace

Angolan President Joao Lourenco hosted a mini-summit in Addis Ababa last week to revive peace efforts. Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, Rwanda's Paul Kagame, and other heads of state participated.

For Johnson Butaragaza, former president of the North Kivu Youth Parliament, the positive aspect of this meeting was to prove Rwanda's direct involvement in the conflict. "Because if it were not Rwanda, the African Union would not be asking the DRC to engage in a dialogue with Rwanda, but rather with M23," Butaragaza told DW told DW.

The United Nations decided to end its 25-year peacekeeping mission (MONUSCO) in eastern Congo by the end of 2024 at the request of President Felix Tshisekedi. A multinational force from South Africa's regional bloc (SADC) is stepping in, but observers say this could bring them into direct conflict with Rwanda.

Kristof Titeca says the key to resolving the crisis lies in Kigali. "The US has imposed some sanctions on individuals, but Rwanda remains a donor darling."

Rwanda remains a critical geopolitical player in the region. Many view it as an example of how donor aid should be implemented, with its efficient health sector cited as an example. Foreign states were very hesitant to sanction Rwanda, Titeca said.

However, Titeca does not believe a war between DRC and Rwanda is likely — the costs would be too high. "Furthermore, the Congolese army does not have the best reputation in terms of efficiency and functionality. The success of a Congolese operation would not be guaranteed."

KAVUMU, Congo (AP) — Health authorities have struggled to contain outbreaks of mpox in Congo, a huge central African country where a myriad of existing problems makes stemming the spread particularly hard.

Last month, the World Health Organization declared the outbreaks in Congo and about a dozen other African countries a global health emergency. And in Congo, scientists have identified a new strain of mpox that may spread more easily. It has reached areas where conflict and the displacement of a large number of people have already put health services under pressure.

Overall, Congo has more than 21,000 of the 25,093 confirmed and suspected mpox cases in Africa this year, according to WHO’s most recent count.

Has Congo seen cases of mpox before?

Yes, Congo is one of the African countries where mpox has been endemic for decades.

Mpox, once known as monkeypox, comes from the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms such as fever. People with more serious cases can develop skin lesions. More than 720 people in Africa have died in the latest outbreaks, mostly in Congo.

Mpox is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread to humans from infected animals. In the global mpox outbreak of 2022, the virus spread between people primarily through sex and close physical contact.

What changed in Congo?

In September 2023, mpox spread to Congo’s eastern province of South Kivu; it had previously been seen in the center and far west. Scientists then identified a new form of mpox in South Kivu that may be more infectious.

The WHO said that from the outbreak in South Kivu, the virus spread among people elsewhere in the country, arriving in neighboring province North Kivu. Those two provinces — some 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) from the capital, Kinshasa — face escalating violence, a humanitarian crisis and other issues.

What are the problems in eastern Congo?

More than 120 armed groups have been fighting each other and the Congolese army for years in the eastern part of the country over the control of minerals. That has forced millions of people fleeing violence into refugee camps or nearby towns.

That means mpox is hitting already-stretched health facilities. Dr. Musole Mulambamunva Robert, medical director of the Kavumu hospital in eastern Congo, said it is “truly a challenge” — sometimes treating as many as four times the facility’s capacity for patients.

With more than 6 million displaced people in the east, authorities and aid agencies were already struggling to provide food and healthcare, while fighting other diseases such as cholera. Many people have no access to soap, clean water or other basics.

Some eastern Congo communities are out of reach of health clinics — roads are unreliable, and hourslong risky boat trips are sometimes the only means of transport, said Mercy Muthee Lake of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent.

People can be more susceptible to severe mpox cases because of malnutrition and undiagnosed HIV, she said.

She also said health workers in eastern Congo have requested more mpox training as medications to treat fever and ease pain run out.

Health authorities “are up against it because it’s such a complex area,” said Chris Beyrer, of Duke University’s Global Health Institute.

What about vaccines?

Africa has no capacity to produce mpox vaccines. Around 250,000 doses have arrived in Congo from the European Union and the United States, and more are expected. Congolese authorities say they need around 3 million vaccines. It will likely be weeks before any vaccines reach people in eastern Congo.

For now, the vaccine is approved only for adults. There’s limited evidence of how it works in children.

Vaccines are desperately needed, but they’re just “an additional tool,” said Emmanuel Lampaert, the Congo representative for Doctors Without Borders. The key, Lampaert said, is still identifying cases, isolating patients, and executing grassroots health and education campaigns.

Local conditions make that trying — Lampaert noted it’s almost impossible to isolate cases among poor, displaced people.

“Families with six to eight children are living in a hut, which is maybe the space of the bed we are sleeping in,” he said. “So, this is the reality.”

Why are critics blasting the mpox response?

Unlike the millions of dollars that poured into Congo for Ebola and COVID aid, the response to mpox has been sluggish, many critics say.

Health experts say the sharp contrast is due to a lack of both funds and international interest.

“Ebola is the most dangerous virus in the world, and COVID wiped out the world economy,” said professor Ali Bulabula, who works on infectious diseases in the medical department at Congo’s University of Kindu. “While mpox is a public health emergency of international concern, there is a lack of in-depth research and interest in the virus, as it’s still seen as a tropical disease, localized to Africa with no major impact on Western economies.”

Chants and slogans expressed frustration and anger against Rwanda, accused of supporting the M23 rebels. Hundreds of demonstrators from Butembo, in eastern DRC, took to the streets this Tuesday to show their support for the Congolese armed forces and, above all, to oppose any negotiations with the rebels.

"We stand behind them, we support them, and we call on them to launch offensives. From today, we intend to work with them to fight the enemy. Our regions are occupied, and that is why we are asking them. We also ask them to reject any order to withdraw without justification, especially politically motivated messages," said Frank Mukendi, a protester.

This anger erupted as the DRC and Rwanda continue negotiations in Luanda to try to resolve the conflict in the region.

"Rwanda claims every day that there are FDLR members in the DRC and that we need to track them down. That’s Rwanda’s daily argument, but I see it as a total distraction, which is why we keep asking our government to support our republican army, the FARDC, for lasting peace," said Muhindo Shafi, a member of civil society.

The demonstrators also denounced massacres carried out by the terrorist group ADF in North Kivu, massacres that have been ongoing since October 2014. According to civil society, there have already been more than 17,000 deaths.

"We are being massacred in Beni, in the Lubero territory. We say enough is enough. Provide all necessary means to the FARDC so they can strike against the M23 and ADF rebels. Today, I am protesting to say no to negotiations," said Rose Kahavu, a protester.

Operations are underway in the area involving both the Congolese and Ugandan armies, but these efforts have yet to put an end to the violence. On Sunday, October 13, during a meeting with Ugandan officers, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi gave clear instructions to strengthen military cooperation between the DRC and Uganda to eradicate insecurity in this region.

In eastern Congo, people are trapped between relentless fighting in their villages and overcrowded camps with scarce food and rampant mpox. Survival is a daily struggle in the conflict-ridden region.

People who are displaced within the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) face a significant dilemma.

Those who ended up in overcrowded camps around Goma in North Kivu province are experiencing deteriorating conditions and food shortages, prompting them to return to the homes they fled due to fighting in the country's conflict-hit east.

However, they often find themselves in danger in their local villages and end up returning to the camps out of desperation.

"I lived in the camp for over a year. We suffered a lot and had too little food," one affected Congolese man told DW.

Even after his return, he struggled daily to survive amid a worsening situation that led to increased hardship and looting.

He is not facing this dilemma alone. Hundreds of people are currently being forced to return to their home villages despite the dangers, due to the poor supply situation in the camps.

The struggle against M23 rebels and the plight of the displaced

On the border with Rwanda in eastern Congo, the Congolese army is engaged in conflict against rebels from the M23 group, one of more than 120 armed groups that have been fighting for a share of the region's gold and other mineral resources — which include major deposits of copper, gold and diamonds — and committing mass killings in the process.

For years, Congo, the United Nations and Western countries have accused Rwanda of supporting the rebels in order to control the region's lucrative mineral resources. Rwanda has repeatedly denied the accusations.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi on Wednesday called on the international community to sanction Rwanda for its role in "destabilizing" his country.

"The resurgence of terrorist group M23, supported by Rwanda, has provoked a humanitarian crisis without precedent," Tshisekedi said during his speech at the UN General Assembly, adding that fighting in the DRC internally displaced more than 7 million people.

The conflict, which has been going on for years, has created the highest number of internally displaced persons in Africa, particularly in the areas around Goma — but also in the provinces of Ituri and North and South Kivu, said Alex Vines, Africa program director at the London-based think tank Chatham House.

"This is a serious crisis that requires more international support," Vines told DW, adding that the international community is largely indifferent to the unimaginable suffering in eastern Congo.

Struggle for peace amid humanitarian crisis

In recent weeks, however, there have been hopes of an end to the spiral of violence as cease-fire agreements between Congo and Rwanda came into force on August 4.

And on September 9 and 10, representatives from both sides met in Luanda under the mediation of Angola. The aim was to reach a peace deal to end the conflict in eastern Congo. But Vines pointed out that the cease-fire was not holding.

Earlier this month, there was another militia attack in which more than a dozen villagers were killed in northeastern Congo, according to media reports. Rebels from the Cooperative for the Diversion of Congo (CODECO), a loose association of militia groups, killed at least 20 people with guns and machetes in the Djugu area, local chief Jean-Marie Makpela told the Associated Press news agency.

Following the brutal attack, the civil society coordinator in the region, Dieudonne Lossa, appealed to the authorities in Ituri to put an end to this "repeated tragedy."

One 43-year-old described her four-month ordeal. Together with her four children, she finally arrived in her home village, Kibirizi, which is under the control of M23 rebels.

"It was a life of extreme pain," she told DW. "We slept in churches. Since our return, we have been exposed to looting every night. We live in constant fear and are totally insecure."

Displaced families face conflict, poverty and mpox outbreak

Many displaced people reported similar experiences.

Another man affected by the humanitarian crisis said that a dignified life is not possible in the displaced persons' camps due to poverty. "That's why we decided to return home. But the rebels are fighting here too, even in our fields."

The situation in North Kivu remains critical. While the conflicts continue and the camps are emptying, thousands of families are trapped between war and misery.

Additionally, Congo is the epicenter of an mpox outbreak across Africa.

The World Health Organization (WHO) approved an mpox vaccine primarily for adults earlier this month. The shot is already being used in Congo and several other African countries.

Other vaccines are in the testing phase. Experts estimate that around 10 million doses could be necessary to contain the mpox outbreak.

Tejshri Shah, director general of Doctors Without Borders (MSF), emphasized that it would be impossible to contain the virus in the camps for displaced people — unless efforts are made to address the needs of the people and improve the appalling living conditions with which they have been struggling.

Title: &#039;Mystery disease&#039; in Congo turned out to be malaria &mdash; and potentially, another disease

Early this month, health officials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported that an unknown, flu-like illness had killed dozens in the country within a few months. The World Health Organization (WHO) investigated, alongside local authorities.

Finally, on Tuesday (Dec. 17), the cause of the sicknesses was announced: severe malaria potentially complicated by malnutrition. Reuters covered the news, citing a statement from the Congo's health ministry that read, "The mystery has finally been solved." At the time, the case count was 592, with the earliest cases occurring in October.

But then, on Dec. 19, a man in the affected region died with symptoms of hemorrhagic fever , the Associated Press (AP) reported . This type of disease is typically caused by viruses — hinting that malaria and malnutrition might not be the only culprits.

As it stands, 37 deaths tied to the "mystery illness" have been confirmed in health care facilities, and additionally, 44 deaths documented in communities remain under investigation, the AP reported. Earlier estimates of the death toll ranged from 67 to 143.

Live Science spoke with experts about why the drivers behind these mystery illnesses have been so tricky to pin down.

"It's very difficult to say," said Benjamin Mordmüller , leader of the experimental medical parasitology group at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. "It could be many things."

Challenges to diagnosis

The Congo has a high incidence of malaria , a parasitic disease spread by mosquitoes. In 2022, the most recent year with data, the country reported over 27 million infections and over 24,000 deaths from the disease. For context, across all of Africa that year, there were 233 million malaria infections and 580,000 deaths.

Although malaria is endemic to the Congo, pinpointing the disease as a culprit in the unfolding situation is a complicated task.

"It is very difficult to attribute a disease like this to malaria," said Mordmüller, who has conducted malaria research and vaccine trials in various countries, including Gabon and the Republic of Congo. "In this region, also at this time of the year, many children will have malaria parasites in the blood." On Dec. 10 , WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that most of the cases and deaths have affected children under 14.

Dr. Matthew Ippolito , an associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute, works in neighboring Zambia and noted that, at any given time, about 50% of the people in areas like this are walking around with malaria parasites in their blood.

"But that doesn't mean that they have the symptoms," Mordmüller added. In places where malaria is very common, many people may not show symptoms because they have some level of existing immunity. "So they could have something else, plus parasites in the blood."

To confirm an illness is driven by malaria, you need diagnostic tests to rule out other causes. Clinically, Mordmüller said, symptomatic malaria can look a lot like other diseases, such as the flu — causing fever, headache, fatigue and chills early on. These nondescript symptoms make tests all the more important.

But as the WHO noted , "there is no functional laboratory in the health zone or province, requiring the collection and shipment of samples to Kinshasa [the nation's capital] for analysis."

The illnesses are happening in the remote Panzi health zone, located within the Kwango province in southwestern Congo. Reaching this rural area from Kinshasa takes 48 hours by road, and at this time of year, the rainy season makes the journey more difficult. Rain also boosts the number of malaria cases by increasing the number of suitable habitats for mosquitoes to lay eggs, Mordmüller added.

Complicated cases

The illnesses have been associated with coughs and runny noses; coughs are sometimes seen in malaria, but not typically runny noses. That said, "malaria can predispose you to other infections," since it strains the immune system's resources, Ippolito told Live Science. So the runny noses may stem from another disease, such as influenza.

In the deadly cases, difficulty breathing and acute malnutrition have often been observed.

Severe malaria is sometimes associated with "respiratory distress," but it's not always easy to identify the cause in places where even routine lab tests are not readily available, Ippolito said. The belabored breathing may stem from having too much acid in the blood , due to effects of the malaria parasites, or the parasites may be directly injuring lung tissue, he said.

The interaction of malnutrition with malaria is poorly understood, both Mordmüller and Ippolito said. Some studies suggest malnutrition may amplify malaria's effects, while others suggest it suppresses the symptoms. "You're not only starving the person, but you're starving the parasite as well, in a sense," Ippolito explained. So it's complicated.

The Kwango province's food insecurity worsened between spring and fall of 2024, the WHO noted. Also this year, much of southern Africa, including the Congo, experienced long dry spells, likely tied to climate change , CNN reported . Ippolito wondered how the droughts factor into the current malnutrition.

What can be done now?

Diagnostic tests and medications are now being transported to the Panzi health zone. Factors like limited mobile phone and internet network coverage complicate this effort. But assuming at least some of the diseases are caused by malaria, the medicines being deployed should help, Mordmüller said.

Given the case of hemorrhagic fever, though, a yet-unidentified virus may be another factor to contend with.

In last week's address, the WHO Director-General said, "It's possible that more than one disease is involved." Mordmüller and Ippolito echoed similar sentiments. Ultimately, time will tell what the full story is.

Despite recent military gains, eastern DRC remains mired in conflict, mainly as a result of the M23 rebellion.

Several towns that fell to armed groups in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have been recaptured by government forces, according to the Congolese army.

The Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC) said some of the recovered towns have been occupied by rebels for months, including Ngungu, a key town in the Masisi territory that is near North Kivu’s provincial capital, Goma. Towns in South Kivu province have also been retaken.

“They [the rebels] have seen their adventure come to a halt by the FARDC,” Guillaume Ndjike Kaiko, army spokesman in North Kivu, told reporters, listing the other recovered towns as Lumbishi, Ruzirantaka, Kamatale, Bitagata and Kabingo.

“All over there, they have been pushed back,” Kaiko said on Sunday, attributing the victories to a joint military operation led by the commanders of the provinces.

Still, rebels have made advances in other areas amid intense fighting in the conflict-battered region. Some Masisi villages remain under the control of rebels, including its centre known as the Masisi Center.

DRC’s eastern region has been embroiled in conflict for decades, with more than 100 armed groups vying for territory in the mineral-rich region, near the border with Rwanda. Since 2022, the M23 rebel group has been embroiled in a conflict with the army that has displaced nearly two million people. Kinshasa and the United Nations accuse Rwanda of supporting M23 with troops and weapons – something Rwanda denies.

Conflict in this region has created one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. Since 1998, approximately six million people have been killed while roughly seven million have been displaced internally.

‘We hope we will have a safe place’

News of the reclaiming of the towns brought mixed feelings among villagers who fled the areas. They worried about their safety as they celebrated their return home.

“We are in Ngungu, but we continue to suffer because the security is not well established,” said Nsabimana Alexis, a resident. “People continue to die, we just buried a person 30 minutes ago,” he said.

Rita Ritagaza, another Ngungu resident, told Al Jazeera, “We are trying to get far away from the area. M23 have been launching heavy artillery on our homes. We hope we will have a safe place for our family away from here.”

Frequent clashes between Congolese forces and M23 rebels have made dozens of villages inaccessible and out of the reach of aid.

“Conditions are really difficult. We’re overstretched and we’re looking at a grim future,” said David Munkley, NGO World Vision director for the Eastern DRC.

In Masisi, displaced camps and aid facilities are being squeezed as more people try to seek refuge from the violence, French charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said.

“We are doing our best to respond to this situation. But the severe lack of humanitarian responders in the area is making things difficult,” said Romain Briey, the MSF coordinator in Masisi.

KAMITUGA, Congo (AP) — Slumped on the ground over a mound of dirt, Divine Wisoba pulled weeds from her daughter’s grave. The 1-month-old died from mpox in eastern Congo in August, but Wisoba, 21, was too traumatized to attend the funeral.

In her first visit to the cemetery, she wept into her shirt for the child she lost and worried about the rest of her family. “When she was born, it was as if God had answered our prayers — we wanted a girl,” Wisoba said of little Maombi Katengey. “But our biggest joy was transformed into devastation.”

Her daughter is one of more than 6,000 people officials suspect have contracted the disease in South Kivu province, the epicenter of the world’s latest mpox outbreak, in what the World Health Organization has labeled a global health emergency. A new strain of the virus is spreading, largely through skin-to-skin contact, including but not limited to sex. A lack of funds, vaccines and information is making it difficult to stem the spread, according to alarmed disease experts.

Mpox — which causes mostly mild symptoms like fever and body aches, but can trigger serious cases with prominent blisters on the face, hands, chest and genitals — had been spreading mostly undetected for years in Africa, until a 2022 outbreak reached more than 70 countries. Globally, gay and bisexual men made up the vast majority of cases in that outbreak. But officials note mpox has long disproportionately affected children in Africa, and they say cases are now rising sharply among kids, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups, with many types of close contact responsible for the spread.

Health officials have zeroed in on Kamituga, a remote yet bustling gold mining town of some 300,000 people that attracts miners, sex workers and traders who are constantly on the move. Cases from other parts of eastern Congo can be traced back here, officials say, with the first originating in the nightclub scene.

Since this outbreak began, one year ago, nearly 1,000 people in Kamituga have been infected. Eight have died, half of them children.

Challenges on the ground

Last month, the World Health Organization said mpox outbreaks might be stopped in the next six months, with governments’ leadership and cooperation.

But in Kamituga, people say they face a starkly different reality.

There’s a daily average of five new cases at the general hospital, which is regularly near capacity. Overall in South Kivu, weekly new suspected cases have skyrocketed from about 12 in January to 600 in August, according to province health officials.

Even that’s likely an underestimate, they say, because of a lack of access to rural areas, the inability of many residents to seek care, and Kamituga’s transient nature.

Locals say they simply don’t have enough information about mpox.

Before her daughter got sick, Wisoba said, she was infected herself but didn’t know it.

Painful lesions emerged around her genitals, making walking difficult. She thought she had a common sexually transmitted infection and sought medicine at a pharmacy. Days later, she went to the hospital with her newborn and was diagnosed with mpox. She recovered, but her daughter developed lesions on her foot.

Nearly a week later, Maombi died at the same hospital that treated her mother.

Wisoba said she didn’t know about mpox until she got it. She wants the government to invest more in teaching people protective measures.

Local officials can’t reach areas more than a few miles outside Kamituga to track suspected cases or inform residents. They broadcast radio messages but say that doesn’t reach far enough.

Kasindi Mwenyelwata goes door to door describing how to detect mpox — looking for fevers, aches or lesions. But the 42-year-old community leader said a lack of money means he doesn’t have the right materials, such as posters showing images of patients, which he finds more powerful than words.

ALIMA, one of the few aid groups working on mpox in Kamituga, lacks funds to set up programs or clinics that would reach some 150,000 people, with its budget set to run out at year’s end, according to program coordinator Dr. Dally Muamba.

If support keeps waning and mpox spreads, he said, “there will be an impact on the economy, people will stop coming to the area as the epidemic takes its toll. ... And as the disease grows, will resources follow?”

The vaccine vacuum

Health experts agree: What’s needed most are vaccines — even if they go only to adults, under emergency approval in Congo.

None has arrived in Kamituga, though it’s a priority city in South Kivu, officials said. It’s unclear when or how they will. The main road into town is unpaved — barely passable by car during the ongoing rainy season.

Once they make it here, it’s unclear whether supply will meet demand for those who are at greatest risk and first in line: health staff, sex workers, miners and motorcycle taxi drivers.

Congo’s government has budgeted more than $190 million for its initial mpox response, which includes the purchase of 3 million vaccine doses, according to a draft national mpox plan, widely circulating among health experts and aid groups this month and seen by The Associated Press. But so far, just 250,000 doses have arrived in Congo and the government’s given only $10 million, according to the finance ministry.

Most people with mild cases recover in less than two weeks. But lesions can get infected, and children or immunocompromised people are more prone to severe cases.

Doctors can ensure lesions are clean and give pain medication or antibiotics for secondary infections such as sepsis.

But those who recover can get the virus again.

A new variant, a lack of understanding

Experts say a lack of resources and knowledge about the new strain makes it difficult to advise people on protecting themselves. An internal report circulated among aid groups and agencies and seen by AP labeled confidence in the available information about mpox in eastern Congo and neighboring countries low.

While the variant is known to be more easily transmissible through sex, it’s unclear how long the virus remains in the system. Doctors tell recovered patients to abstain from sex for three months, but acknowledge the number is largely arbitrary.

“Studies haven’t clarified if you’re still contagious or not ... if you can or can’t have sex with your wife,” said Dr. Steven Bilembo, of Kamituga’s general hospital.

Doctors say they’re seeing cases they simply don’t understand, such as pregnant women losing babies. Of 32 pregnant women infected since January, nearly half lost the baby through miscarriage or stillbirth, hospital statistics show.

Alice Neema was among them. From the hospital’s isolation ward, she told AP she’d noticed lesions around her genitals and a fever — but didn’t have enough money to travel the 30 miles (50 kilometers) on motorbike for help in time. She miscarried after her diagnosis.

As information trickles in, locals say fear spreads alongside the new strain.

Diego Nyago said he’d brought his 2-year-old son, Emile, in for circumcision when he developed a fever and lesions.

It was mpox — and today, Nyago is grateful health care workers noticed his symptoms.

“I didn’t believe that children could catch this disease,” he said as doctors gently poured water over the boy to bring his temperature down. “Some children die quickly, because their families aren’t informed.

“Those who die are the ones who stay at home.”

Title: Congo army reclaims key areas from M23 rebels

Amid escalating violence in the eastern regions of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Congolese army has announced significant military gains against the M23 rebel group. Over the weekend, the Congolese military reported that it had successfully pushed back M23 forces from South Kivu and recaptured several key towns in both North and South Kivu provinces.

Guillaume Ndjike Kaiko, a spokesperson for the Congolese army, confirmed these developments in a statement to the press. He emphasised that the military had regained control of multiple localities that had been under M23's occupation.

"It’s true that we are observing the ceasefire. But at least, (civilians) should be assured that each time the Rwandan army fires on our positions or on our population or on displaced people, the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo have the right to react.”

Kaiko's comments come amid heightened tensions in the region, where fighting between the Congolese army and the M23 rebels has intensified over the past several weeks. The M23, a predominantly Tutsi rebel group, first emerged in 2012 and briefly seized the city of Goma, which lies on the border with Rwanda. The group's name derives from a peace agreement signed in March 2009, which M23 claims the Congolese government failed to implement.

After a period of dormancy, the M23 re-emerged in late 2021, quickly advancing and capturing large swathes of territory in eastern Congo. The United Nations has accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebels, a claim that Rwanda has consistently denied. In response to the ongoing conflict, Rwandan President Paul Kagame recently called for negotiations between the Congolese government and the M23 rebels, urging a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

The United Nations’ allegations, raised in a report last year, suggest that thousands of Rwandan soldiers have been fighting alongside M23 forces in eastern Congo. However, Rwanda has rejected these claims, maintaining that it only provides humanitarian assistance to the region and has no involvement in the fighting.

As the conflict continues to evolve, the international community remains concerned about the humanitarian impact of the violence, particularly on the hundreds of thousands of displaced people caught in the crossfire. The DRC government insists that its military will continue to defend the nation’s sovereignty and protect its citizens from external threats.
