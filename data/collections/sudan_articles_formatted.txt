CARE, SUDAN – 31 July 2025 – Conflict continues to ravage Sudan, driving over 25.6 million people , 54% of the population, into hunger. Of these, 3.7 million are children aged below the age of five, many of whom are acutely malnourished and suffering irreversible harm. In some areas of Darfur, one in three children suffers from acute malnutrition, surpassing famine thresholds. The humanitarian response to address this hunger and malnutrition, as well as the overall dire needs, is unable to keep pace as funding cuts continue to cripple operations. The CARE Sudan team is seeing an increase in children arriving at displacement camps in East Darfur

“Hunger and malnutrition are taking hold of innocent people caught up in vicious conflict. Unaccompanied children are arriving alone in East Darfur, starving, and deeply traumatized,” said Abdirahman Ali, CARE Sudan’s Country Director. “Conflict, access challenges, and now severe funding cuts are worsening the catastrophe. Response services are collapsing, and the Nutrition sector, responsible for coordinating lifesaving efforts across Sudan, remains chronically underfunded. This means that the children who need help the most are receiving almost nothing. If the world continues to look away, more and more lives will slip away.”

Currently, the nutrition sector response is only 12% funded. Over 637,000 people are experiencing catastrophic, life-threatening hunger, which is the worst level possible on the global scale for measuring hunger crises.

The sharp drop in international funding has only worsened the crisis. Major cuts have forced agencies and local organizations to reduce or suspend operations in many areas. This has meant less food, fewer therapeutic nutrition programs for the severely malnourished, and no safety net for the increasing number of displaced children arriving daily. In East Darfur, the number of severely malnourished children has soared. These children, already weak from hunger and mental turmoil, struggle to fight off deadly diseases like cholera, which is spreading across the country.

Fatima*, a 45-year-old mother of five, fled the conflict in Nyala, South Darfur, and sought refuge in Alnaeem IDP camp in East Darfur. “After the long, painful journey, the community kitchen gave us comfort, as now my children were finally able to get a meal,” she said. But when the kitchen shut down due to funding cuts, everything changed. Families began skipping meals, eating late, and watching their children grow weak and sick. We started suffering again,” she added.

CARE Sudan, alongside local partner Emergency Response Rooms, is responding through three community kitchens run by community volunteers in Alnaeem camp, which shelters displaced people and families. These kitchens are a vital lifeline, serving hot meals to 18,000 people, mostly women and children. At the same time, families receive a food basket that contains sugar, lentils, oil, flour, and salt, which should be enough for one month. But without adequate and consistent funding, even these services are at risk of ceasing, just like many others that already have.

“We are calling on donors and governments to honor pledges and increase much-needed funding to the Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan,” Ali said. “These children are our collective responsibility. Every day that passes without food, clean water, and much-needed nutritional supplements brings them closer to death. We need immediate and sustained investment in nutrition and food to protect and save these lives today and in the difficult weeks ahead.”

CARE Sudan urges immediate restoration and increased support for the nutrition response. The children displaced by conflict in Sudan did not choose war, hunger, or fear.

El Uweinat / Shaq El Noum / Khartoum / El Fasher / El Gezira — Sudan's humanitarian situation worsened dramatically in June and July 2025, with mounting violence, a deadly cholera outbreak, and mass displacement, according to recent reports from the African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS), the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.

Over 500,000 people were newly displaced in June alone, pushing the total to more than two million since April 2023. In their report posted yesterday, the ACJPS called it "one of the world's most severe humanitarian emergencies," marked by widespread violations.

The paramilitary RSF withdrew from Khartoum but entrenched themselves in West Kordofan and in the El Uweinat area, at the border triangle connecting Sudan, Libya, and Egypt, while governance and judicial systems collapsed nationwide. The Sudanese Lawyers' Union condemned new fees on criminal cases as unjust.

Attacks in North Kordofan's Shaq El Noum reportedly perpetrated by the RSF, killed over 300 civilians, according to recent metrics in the OCHA report, published today. Kadugli in South Kordofan remains cut off from aid amid worsening fighting and hunger. Armed groups attempted to seize food from markets, highlighting desperation.

Torrential rains and flooding in West Darfur have blocked roads, threatening to isolate towns sheltering thousands of displaced people.

Cholera has infected over 91,000 people in 17 states, killing at least 2,300. WHO warned of a looming health catastrophe without humanitarian corridors and ceasefires, especially in besieged El Fasher, capital of North Darfur.

A vaccination campaign in Khartoum cut daily cases from 1,500 to under 30, but funding gaps risk stalling progress. OCHA reports only 23 per cent of 2025 funding needs met, leaving a $3 billion shortfall.

Radio Dabanga reported last week Sudan's childhood immunisation rate has fallen to 48 per cent, the lowest in 40 years, according to the World Health Organisation and the UN Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF), leaving 880,000 infants at risk of diseases like tetanus and diphtheria.

In a briefing yesterday, UN spokesperson for the Secretary-General, Stéphane Dujarric, said worsening conditions and funding shortfalls severely hamper aid, with community kitchens in North Darfur at risk of closure.

He urged "unimpeded humanitarian access, more funding, protection for civilians and aid workers, and an immediate end to hostilities."

Returnees to El Gezira are facing widespread devastation. Osman Bashir Mohammed Ali told OCHA, "We took only what we could carry... I don't know how to start again. This place... it's unrecognisable."

A power struggle between two rival generals has effectively split Sudan amid a 27-month civil war that has left some 150,000 people dead.

Deepening the crisis in civil war-torn Sudan, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Saturday announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, raising fears of permanent division in the country.

At a press conference in the RSF-controlled city of Nyala in South Darfur, the paramilitary announced a 15-member presidential council with RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, as its president.

Rebel leader Abdelaziz al-Hilu, head of the SPLM-N, was named vice president.

Mohamed Hassan al-Taishi, a civilian politician, was appointed prime minister. He was a former member of Sudan's Transitional Sovereign Council from 2019 until the 2021 military coup.

New regional governors, including one for Darfur, were also announced. The region now has rival governors from each side.

Rebels look to establish secular 'New Sudan'

The RSF move stoked fears of escalating Sudan's 27-month civil war as it directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government, which was formed in May under former United Nations official Kamil Idris but remains incomplete with unfilled Cabinet positions.

An agreement in February among paramilitary, rebel, and civilian groups paved the way for the new government looking to establish a secular "New Sudan," the RSF said.

International legitimacy will also allow the faction to secure advanced arms imports.

The Sudanese army, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has not formally responded but had previously condemned any attempt to create a parallel administration.

UN officials warned that the RSF's formation of a parallel government risks further fragmenting Sudan and undermining diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.

How did the conflict in Sudan begin?

The conflict began in April 2023 as a power struggle between Burhan and Dagalo, once allies who ousted long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir in 2019 before turning on each other in a 2021 coup that derailed Sudan's transition to democracy.

The country is now effectively split with the army controlling the north, east, and center, having recently retaken the capital Khartoum, while the RSF holds most of Darfur and parts of Kordofan, where fighting has surged.

Meanwhile, Burhan is under US sanctions for the usage of chemical weapons in 2024 against the RSF.

Since the war began up to 13 million people have been displaced and large parts of the population are on the brink of famine, according to UN data. Around 150,000 people are estimated to have been killed.

A new wave of violence has erupted in Sudan’s North Kordofan state, with activists reporting that almost 300 people have been killed in attacks that began over the weekend.

The Emergency Lawyers, a Sudanese human rights group, say the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched coordinated assaults on villages surrounding the city of Bara, which is currently under RSF control. In the village of Shag Alnom alone, more than 200 people were reportedly killed, either shot or burned to death in arson attacks.

Looting raids in neighboring villages claimed another 38 civilian lives, according to the group, while dozens more remain missing. On Sunday, the RSF allegedly attacked the village of Hilat Hamid, killing 46 people, including pregnant women and children.

North Kordofan has become one of the central battlegrounds in Sudan’s civil war, which broke out in April 2023 between the RSF and the country’s national army. The conflict has devastated communities across the nation and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world today.

Since the start of the war, tens of thousands of people have been killed, and more than 13 million have been displaced from their homes, according to humanitarian agencies.

As the violence intensifies, human rights organizations and aid groups are calling on the international community to act swiftly. They warn that without urgent intervention, civilians will remain at the mercy of escalating attacks and deepening instability.

Title: MSF: Access to healthcare in Sudan &#039;almost impossible&#039; as attacks on healthcare facilities increase

Humanitarian organisations are sounding the alarm over attacks on healthcare facilities in Sudan, warning that 70 percent of them are closed or barely operational.

In a new report entitled ’Besieged, Attacked, Starved,’ Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders, said that access to healthcare is nearly impossible due to systematic attacks, while the remaining operational facilities are under constant threat.

“We call to all warring parties to stop violence against the civilian health facilities and civilian infrastructure and to facilitate a large-scale humanitarian response,” said Michel-Olivier Lacharité, MSF head of emergency operations, on Thursday as the report was released.

Save the Children echoed those concerns, saying that attacks on hospitals tripled in the first half of this year, with more than 900 people killed while seeking healthcare or accompanying someone to hospital - 60 times the number of deaths compared to the same period last year.

Major hospitals, clinics, health facilities, ambulances, and medical convoys all saw fatal attacks in a country where half the population requires humanitarian assistance, according to Save the Children.

MSF particularly warned against violence in El Fasher city, the capital of North Darfur province, that made it near impossible for residents there and nearby displacement camps to access healthcare.

As of April, only one hospital with surgical capacity remained partially operational, serving an estimated population of over one million. Over the past year, many patients and their caretakers have been killed while inside an MSF-supported medical facility.

International response

Lacharité also urged the international community to take stronger action to address the crisis in Sudan:

"We ask to international actors, UN member states and bodies, the states with influence over the warrying parties, who provide them militarily, economic, or diplomatic support: they must use all the leverage to prevent further mass atrocities, they must place protection of civilians at the core of their engagement with the warring parties.”

Last month, Sudan’s military agreed to a proposal from the United Nations for a week-long ceasefire in El Fasher to allow aid delivery, but the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) didn’t state whether it agrees on the proposal and took part in renewed clashes with the army in the southern part of the city this week.

Sudan’s civil war has been raging since April 2023 after simmering tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary escalated to fighting across the country. Some 40,000 people have been killed, according to UN agencies, and nearly 13 million people have been displaced, including to other countries. Those who remain face food insecurity and risk of famine and are exposed to diseases including cholera, which remains hard to contain due to the collapsed healthcare system.

A fast-spreading cholera outbreak has hit Sudan with officials reporting more than 1,000 cases a day in the capital of the war-torn country.

The outbreak is centred around the capital, Khartoum, and has spread as many Sudanese who had fled the country’s war return home. Residents are often only able to find unclean water - which is a dangerous conduit for the disease - as much of the sanitation system has collapsed amid the civil war.

According to Nicolas Jean, the head of Doctors Without Borders mission in Sudan, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières or MSF, Khartoum is now getting above 1,000 cases a day.

He blamed the lack of clean water, hygiene and lack of access to health care for the rise in the spread of the disease.

Most cases have been reported in Khartoum and its twin city of Omdurman, but cholera was also detected in the provinces of North Kordofan, Sennar, Gazira, White Nile and Nile River, health officials said. Khartoum and Omdurman were a battleground throughout the civil war, which nearly emptied them of residents. The region of the capital was recaptured by the military in late March from its rival, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF.

Since then, some 34,000 people have returned. But the city has been wrecked by months of fighting. Many found their homes damaged. Clean water is difficult to find, in part because attacks on power plants have disrupted electricity and worsened water shortages, UNICEF said. Sanitation systems are damaged.

The "disease of poverty"

Health workers fear the outbreak could spread quickly, since many people are packed into displacement centres making it difficult to isolate those infected.

The health system has also broken down. More than 80% of hospitals are out of service and those that are operating have shortages of water, electricity and medication, said Dr. Sayed Mohamed Abdullah, of Sudan’s Doctors Union.

The World Health Organization describes cholera as a “disease of poverty” because it spreads where there is poor sanitation and a lack of clean water.

It is a diarrheal disease caused when people eat food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is easily treatable with rehydration solutions and antibiotics. Most of those infected have only mild symptoms but, in severe cases, the disease can kill within hours if left untreated.

The WHO’s global stockpile of oral cholera vaccines has dropped below its minimum threshold of 5 million doses, making it increasingly difficult to stop outbreaks

At the same time, cholera epidemics have been on the rise around the world since 2021, because of poverty, conflict and extreme climate events like floods and cyclones, the U.N. says.

The civil war has devastated Sudan since it erupted in April 2023, when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare across the country. At least 24,000 people have been reported killed, though the number is likely far higher.

More than 14 million have been displaced and forced from their homes, including over 4 million who streamed into neighbouring countries. Famine was announced in at least five locations with the epicentre in the wrecked Darfur region.

A displaced mother and her child inspect the remnants of their burnt house in Khor Abeche, South Darfur.

Violence, insecurity and hunger are devastating people's lives in South Darfur, Sudan, according to a new report released today by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).

The report, Voices from South Darfur, illustrates in vivid testimony how the impact of pervasive violence, a healthcare system in ruins and an inadequate international response have all combined to push people's coping strategies to their limits.

"The voices and stories of people reflect the suffering, abuse and cruelty felt throughout communities in South Darfur, but also people's endurance and compassion," says Ozan Agbas, MSF emergency manager for Sudan.

"With civilian protection collapsed and humanitarian aid still inadequate, people in South Darfur demand to be listened to, demand attention, and demand action," says Agbas.

South Darfur experienced intense urban warfare in 2023, which destroyed hospitals and critical infrastructure. The humanitarian presence, substantial before the outbreak of civil war in April that year, disintegrated as fighting took hold. Although ground fighting in South Darfur has ceased for now, insecurity remains, as people are subject to appalling violence on roads and farmland, and in markets and their own homes. Reports of arbitrary detention, theft and looting are also commonplace. Air strikes and drone strikes continue to hit South Darfur and other parts of the country.

Sexual violence is widespread with MSF providing care to 659 survivors from January 2024 to March 2025. Fifty-six per cent of survivors were assaulted by non-civilians.

One woman from South Darfur living in a displacement camp told MSF, "When the women try to go outside the camp to farm... they will beat me, they will torture me... There is no way to go out... My aunt's daughter, she was raped by six men just six days ago... I feel insecure, because if I go out, I will be raped."

People describe the fear and anxiety of their children, and their own feelings of helplessness, indignity and of being trapped.

"Our farms are completely destroyed - we have nothing. My husband was killed four months ago. We have nothing now," an internally displaced woman told MSF in Beleil locality. "For three days, I haven't eaten anything... I don't know what will happen to me on the way home. I am afraid, because those people who killed my husband, maybe they will do the same to me."

The violence has shattered the healthcare system, and adequate care is simply not available for people due to a range of compounding issues: facilities have been destroyed, damaged or abandoned; healthcare workers have fled or are no longer receiving salaries; supplies are absent or interrupted; and people struggle to afford transport to reach what remains of the healthcare system.

Insecurity is intertwined with hunger, as the threat of violence has cut off access to farmland and incomes. Between January 2024 and March 2025 MSF supported programmes in South Darfur that treated over 10,000 children younger than five years old with acute malnutrition and provided nutrition treatment to thousands of malnourished pregnant and breastfeeding women and girls.

The malnutrition crisis is expected to deteriorate even further with the imminent arrival of the rainy and lean seasons. Amid soaring costs of food, families are forced to subsist on one meal a day - sometimes not even that.

"I just depend on what I can find, day to day," says a woman in Al-Salam displacement camp. "If I get something, we will eat. If I don't get something, we won't. This is my life."

Since the war started, the response from international organisations and UN agencies has been sparse, inconsistent and slow to arrive in South Darfur, as a woman in Nyala explained in November 2024: "We heard that international organisations help people, but they never bring anything for us."

There have been some recent signs of improvement, with UN agencies increasingly finding ways to bring humanitarian supplies to South Darfur. NGOs are gradually scaling up their presence and activities. However, due to severe access constraints, UN agencies are still not on the ground in South Darfur to lead and coordinate the response, more than two years into the conflict, and NGOs are moving slowly and with caution.

Communities are working in solidarity to overcome the effects of violence. Neighbours support one another, sharing their food. Groups of young people clear away rubble and unexploded ordnance, and purchase medicines for displaced people living in their neighbourhood. Teachers work for free in looted buildings. MSF has supported local initiatives to help run community kitchens, provide meals for school children and support health posts run by volunteers. Health facilities and water systems have been rehabilitated, and MSF ran a programme that provided food to 6,000 families in multiple locations across the state.

These programmes demonstrate it is possible to support local initiatives and improve services when determination, creativity and a willingness to take risks combine.

"Local organisations in Darfur have the knowledge and expertise to provide essential services. Giving these frontline responders supplies, funding and decision-making power will make a substantial contribution to saving lives," says Agbas.

The testimonies and medical data in Voices from South Darfur were generated through our activities between January 2024 and March 2025.

Appointment of Kamil Idris comes as war between the army and the Rapid Support Forces ravages Sudan.

Sudan’s army chief and de facto head of state, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has appointed former United Nations official Kamil Idris as prime minister, as the country’s civil war grinds on into its third year.

Tens of thousands of people have been killed, critical infrastructure has been destroyed and more than 12 million people have been displaced as a result of the conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

“The chairman of the sovereignty council issued a constitutional decree appointing Kamil El-Tayeb Idris Abdelhafiz as prime minister,” a statement from Sudan’s ruling Transitional Sovereignty Council read on Monday.

The Sovereignty Council, the body that encompassed the Sudanese presidency, has the power to appoint Sudan’s prime minister. However, the prime minister is not a member of the Sovereignty Council, and is instead a different branch of the country’s executive, focused on the day to day running of the government.

Idris, a career diplomat, spent decades at the UN’s World Intellectual Property Organisation and was its director general from 1997 to 2008.

He also held various roles in Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and used to serve in the country’s permanent mission to the UN.

Idris, whose higher education was in international law and international affairs, also ran as an independent candidate in Sudan’s presidential election in 2010 against longtime military ruler Omar al-Bashir, who was later ousted in a 2019 coup.

The African Union on Tuesday welcomed Idris’s appointment, calling it “a step toward inclusive governance” and expressing hope that the move will “restore constitutional order and democratic governance in Sudan”.

On Monday, al-Burhan also added two women to the ruling sovereign council.

The military leader reappointed Salma Abdel Jabbar Almubarak and named Nowara Abo Mohamed Mohamed Tahir to the governing body.

The al-Burhan-led military and the RSF, a paramilitary headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, have been at war for more than two years after the two generals failed to agree on a plan to integrate their forces.

Last month, Dagalo announced the RSF would form a rival administration, shortly after signing a charter with allies in Kenya’s Nairobi. Details still remain unclear, and the make up of the government has yet to be publically announced.

The army, which holds areas in the central, eastern and northern parts of Sudan, has managed to claim some military victories in recent months, including taking control of the capital, Khartoum.

The RSF, which holds most of the western region of Darfur and some areas in the south with its allied militias, has been striking Port Sudan repeatedly this month to devastating effect.

Meanwhile, a worsening humanitarian crisis continues to engulf Sudan.

International organisations and some countries have warned of the risks of further escalating the conflict, including in cities like el-Fasher in Darfur that have served as humanitarian aid hubs.

Sudanese Prime Minister Kamil Idris has dissolved the country's caretaker government, according to reports from state news agency SUNA.

The news came late on Sunday, just one day after Idris took the oath of office as the country’s first prime minister since a military coup four years ago.

In April 2023, Sudan plunged into civil war when tensions between the military and the breakaway group the Rapid Support Forces exploded into open warfare in the capital Khartoum and other parts of the country.

In a speech on Sunday, Idris urged countries supporting the RSF to cease “criminal operations”.

He also vowed to "serve the nation and the Sudanese people with the utmost sincerity and dedication".

Idris did not say when a new government would be appointed.

Devastation of war

At least 24,000 people have been reported killed, though the number is likely far higher.

More than 14 million have been displaced and forced from their homes, including over 4 million who streamed into neighboring countries.

The war has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups.

Famine was announced in at least five locations with the epicenter in the wrecked Darfur region.

The paramilitary group's drone attack on a hospital in the city of El-Obeid resulted in 6 people killed. According to the UN, the conflict in Sudan has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

A suspected drone attack in Sudan by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary hit a hospital, killing six people and wounding at least 12 in the city of El-Obeid.

An army source told the AFP news agency that the RSF attack targeted "residential areas of the city with heavy artillery," also adding the bombardment had also hit a second hospital in the city. Right groups, the Emergency Lawyers, blamed the attack on the RSF.

The hospital was out of service as a result of the attack.

El-Obeid is a city located some 360 kilometers southwest of capital Khartoum. It was besieged by the RSF for almost two years, before the country's army broke the siege in February.

The city has been under RSF bombardment ever since, due to it being key to the army's supply route to the west, where the only city under army control is El-Fasher.

The paramilitary group and the Sudanese army have been clashing along the road between El-Obeid and El-Fasher in recent weeks.

The war between the two sides has killed thousands of people and uprooted 13 million since breaking in April 2023, as well as effectively splitting Sudan into two parts, with the army holding the center, east and north, while the RSF and their allies control nearly all of Darfur and parts of the south.

According to the United Nations (UN), the conflict in Sudan has created the world's biggest hunger and displacement crises. It pushed parts of the country into famine.

The war has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the Darfur region, rights groups said.

A new cholera outbreak in Sudan has killed 172 people and infected more than 2,500 over the past week, authorities said on Tuesday.

Most cases were reported in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, and its twin city of Omdurman, but cholera was also detected in other provinces across the country.

Medical NGO Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières or MSF, said Sudan’s healthcare facilities were unable to cope with the surge of patients.

The cholera spike began in mid-May, with MSF teams treating almost 2,000 suspected cholera cases in the past week alone according to Sudan coordinator for MSF Joyce Bakker.

She said the scenes in treatment centres were “disturbing”, with many patients arriving “too late to be saved.”

“We don’t know the true scale of the outbreak, and our teams can only see a fraction of the full picture”, Bakker added.

She called for a united response, including water, sanitation and hygiene programmes and more treatment facilities.

In March, MSF said that 92 people had died of cholera in Sudan’s White Nile State, where 2,700 people had contracted the disease since late February.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the water-borne disease is a fast-developing and highly contagious infection that causes diarrhoea and leads to severe dehydration and possible death within hours when not treated.

The disease is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.

This cholera outbreak is the latest crisis for Sudan after the country entered its third year of war in April.

At least 20,000 people have been reported killed since fighting began in 2023, though the number is likely far higher, and more than 14 million have been displaced and forced from their homes.

Sudan is also facing what the United Nations says is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, combining war atrocities, disease, famine, and lack of access to safe drinking water.

The country's health minister Haitham Ibrahim attributed the cholera surge around Khartoum to the return of many Sudanese who had fled their homes.

He said their returns had strained the city’s dwindling water resources.

The outbreak in Sudan is part of a larger cholera spread that has reached 18 African countries since January, with the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola and South Sudan among the most affected, according to WHO.

Sudan’s army-aligned government denies allegations that it has used chemical weapons in war against paramilitary rivals.

The United States will impose sanctions on Sudan after determining that the country’s military used chemical weapons last year while fighting against rival paramilitary forces.

“The United States calls on the Government of Sudan to cease all chemical weapons use and uphold its obligations” under the Chemical Weapons Convention, US Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on Thursday.

Bruce said the US Congress has been notified of the State Department’s decision, and sanctions – which include restrictions on US exports to Sudan and a block on access to US government lines of credit – would be imposed around June 6.

Sudan’s Information Minister Khalid al-Aiser rejected the allegations as “baseless”, saying they were “nothing but political blackmail and a deliberate falsification of the facts”.

Bruce’s statement did not include further details about when and where the chemical weapons were used by Sudanese government forces.

The New York Times reported in January that government forces had used chemical weapons on at least two occasions in remote parts of Sudan against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The report cited unnamed US officials who said the weapon may have been chlorine gas, which can lead to severe respiratory pain and death.

Sudan’s army and the RSF have been locked in a civil war since April 2023 following a power struggle between the two sides.

The conflict has created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises and a famine across Sudan, killing thousands and displacing 13 million people.

The US has also previously accused the RSF and its allies of committing genocide, and sanctioned top leaders like the RSF head, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo.

In January, the US also sanctioned Sudan’s military chief and de facto head of state, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, for refusing to participate in international peace talks.

Drone attacks raise stakes in new phase of Sudan's civil war

15 May 2025 Share Save Barbara Plett Usher BBC News Share Save

Reuters Port Sudan, which was once considered a relatively safe city, has been hit by a series of drone attacks targeting key infrastructure

Paramilitary fighters appear to have opened a new phase in Sudan's civil war after being driven from the capital, in a move which some experts have described as a "shock and awe campaign". Just weeks after the army celebrated the recapture of Khartoum, its foe the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) launched a series of unprecedented drone strikes on Port Sudan in the east of the country. The attacks have led to worsening power blackouts, as well as city residents facing water shortages. "It's a level of power projection within this region that we haven't seen yet," says Alan Boswell, the Horn of Africa expert for the International Crisis Group. "I think it raises the stakes quite a bit," he added. The barrage of attacks on the war-time capital and humanitarian hub signals that the RSF is determined and able to carry on the fight despite significant territorial losses. And it has showcased the growth of advanced drone warfare in Africa.

Drones have played an increasing role in the conflict, which has entered its third year. The war began as a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF and has drawn in other Sudanese armed groups and foreign backers, plunging the country into what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) helped the army advance earlier this year. And the RSF escalated its own use of drones as it was pushed out of central Sudan, especially Khartoum, back towards its traditional stronghold in the west of the country. In recent months the paramilitaries had stepped up drone strikes on critical civilian infrastructure in army-controlled areas. That continued on Wednesday night with attacks on three power stations in the city of Omdurman, which lies across the Nile River from Khartoum. The damage has caused widespread electricity outages in the capital region. But it was the RSF's sustained strikes on Port Sudan, until now seen as a safe haven home to government officials, diplomats and humanitarian organisations, that underlined a shift in strategy to a greater emphasis on remote warfare, and aimed to demonstrate strength.

Reuters Some people had fled more dangerous parts of the country to seek safety in Port Sudan, like these women who were pictured sheltering at Abdallah Nagi camp

"The RSF is trying to show that they don't need to reach Port Sudan by land in order to be able to have an impact there," says Sudanese political analyst Kholood Khair. The group is trying to achieve a "narrative shift" away from "the triumphant SAF that took over Khartoum," she says. "It is saying to the Sudanese Armed Forces: 'You can take Khartoum back, but you'll never be able to govern it. You can have Port Sudan, but you won't be able to govern it, because we will cause a security crisis for you so large that it will be ungovernable'... They want to unequivocally show that the war is not over until they say so." The paramilitary group has not directly addressed the Port Sudan drone attacks. Rather, it has repeated its assertion that the SAF is supported by Iran and accused the armed forces of targeting civilian infrastructure and state institutions, calling the military strikes on Khartoum and RSF-held areas in the west and south of the country war crimes. Both sides stand accused of war crimes which they have denied, but the RSF has been singled out over allegations of mass rape and genocide. The change in its tactics may have been triggered by battlefield necessity, but is possible because of technological advancement. The RSF had previously used what are known as suicide or loitering drones, small UAVs with explosive payloads that are designed to crash into targets and can carry out coordinated attacks. It seems to have deployed this method in Port Sudan, with the commander of the Red Sea Military Zone Mahjoub Bushra describing a swarm of 11 Kamikaze drones in the first strike on a military airbase. He said the army shot them down, but they turned out to be a tactical distraction to divert attention from a single strategic drone that successfully struck the base. The make of this drone is not clear. But satellite images reported by Yale researchers and the Reuters news agency have shown advanced UAVs at an airport in South Darfur since the beginning of the year. The defence intelligence company Janes has determined them to most likely be sophisticated Chinese manufactured CH-95s, capable of long-range strikes. Jeremy Binnie, an Africa and Middle East analyst at Jane's, told the BBC that photos of what appear to be the remnants of the smaller kamikaze drones suggest they are probably a different version than the RSF had used before, and might be better at penetrating air defences because of their shape.

Reuters Sudan's war is taking a massive humanitarian toll with citizens fleeing their homes being hit in strikes

One regional observer suggested the RSF had been able to breach the SAF's anti-drone technology with signal jammers attached to the drones, but cautioned this was still unproven. The South Darfur airport in Nyala, the presumptive capital and military base of the Rapid Support Forces, has been repeatedly bombed by the SAF, which destroyed an aircraft there earlier this month. Some experts see the RSF's bombardment of Port Sudan at least partly as retaliation. Inside Khartoum, a city left in ruins

Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happening The escalating drone warfare has again highlighted the role of foreign actors in Sudan's civil conflict. "This is a war of technology," says Justin Lynch, managing director at Conflict Insights Group, a data analytics and research organisation. "That's why the foreign supporters are so important, because it's not like the RSF is making the weapons themselves. They're being given this stuff." The army has accused the United Arab Emirates (UAE) of supplying the paramilitary fighters with the drones, and cut diplomatic ties with Abu Dhabi because of the attacks. The UAE has strongly rejected the charges. It has long denied reports from UN experts, US politicians and international organisations that it is providing weaponry to the RSF. But Mr Lynch says the evidence is overwhelming. He was the lead author of a US State Department-funded report late last year that concluded with "near certainty" the the UAE was facilitating weapons to the RSF by monitoring imagery and flight patterns of airlines previously implicated in violating a UN arms embargo. He told the BBC it would be surprising if the Emiratis were not helping deliver the drones used in the Port Sudan attacks. He also determined with similar near-certainty that the Iranians were supplying weapons to the SAF, and he helped authenticate documents provided to the Washington Post that detail the sale of drones and warheads to the army by a Turkish defence firm. Iran has not responded to the allegations. Turkish officials have denied involvement. The increasing use of drones by both sides may be redefining the war, but it is the ability of the RSF to strike strategic targets hundreds of kilometres from its positions that has rattled the region. Over a week of daily attacks on Port Sudan, the paramilitaries hit the country's only working international airport, a power station, several fuel depots, and the air base, apparently trying to disrupt the army's supply lines. The city is also the main entry port for relief supplies and the UN has warned that this "major escalation" could further complicate aid operations in the country and lead to large-scale civilian casualties. "This was such a shock and awe campaign that it has not only stunned SAF, I think it's also stunned Egypt, Saudi Arabia, others who were behind SAF, and remakes the entire war," says Mr Boswell, adding that it closing the gap in air power between the RSF and the army. "The RSF is widely viewed as a non-state actor," he says "and normally, groups like that can muster quite a bit of an insurgent force. But the government with the air force is the one that always has the aerial capacity, and this just turns all those old adages on its head."

The development has triggered comparisons to the long-range drone warfare between Russia and Ukraine. "These weapons have more precision, you don't need a manned aircraft any more, and they are much more affordable than operating sophisticated jets," says Mr Binnie. "This is part of a broader trend in technological proliferation where you can see what used to be really high-end capabilities being used in a civil war in sub-Saharan Africa." The Sudanese foreign ministry has warned that the attacks threaten regional security and the safety of navigation in the Red Sea, calling on international actors to take "effective action against the regional sponsor of the militia," a reference to the UAE. Mr Lynch believes that only an agreement between the UAE and the Sudanese army will end the war. "This war is always evolving, always changing," he says, "but you'll see it will continue for years and decades unless there is serious diplomatic action to stop it."

Sudan rebels entirely pushed out of Khartoum state, army says

The civil war in Sudan has led to widespread destruction in Sudan's capital city Khartoum

Earlier on Tuesday, fighting had broken out between the warring groups in the city of Omdurman - which is also in Khartoum state and part of the capital region.

The announcement comes nearly two months after the military recaptured Khartoum city - including the presidential palace - from its rivals in a major victory.

"Khartoum State is completely free of rebels", the army said in a statement published by Sudan's News Agency.

The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) group, which has been engaged in a two-year war with Sudan's army, has been entirely pushed out of Khartoum state, says the military.

The army said on Monday that it had started a "large-scale offensive" in Omdurman, according to the AFP news agency.

The RSF has not yet commented on the army's latest claim.

Khartoum had once been at the heart of Sudan's government, but the country's military leaders were forced to move east to Port Sudan after their rivals took control of the area.

Until recently Port Sudan had been viewed as relatively safe, however it was at the centre of escalating fighting when it came under drone attack earlier this month, which the army blamed on the RSF.

The attacks hit key infrastructure and led to water shortages and worsening blackouts.

The war has also had diplomatic reverberations, with relations souring between Sudan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), after Sudan accused the gulf nation of supporting the RSF, which it denies.

Those accusations continued on Tuesday, with Sudan saying the UAE was responsible for an attack on Port Sudan earlier this month, Reuters news agency reported.

The UAE has strongly denied the accusations, describing them as "unfounded allegations".

Since the civil war erupted more than two years ago, thousands of people have died and millions have been displaced from their homes - creating the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

Both the army and the RSF have been accused of war crimes, which they deny.

No water, no power - Port Sudan reeling after week of attacks

10 May 2025 Share Save Mohamed Osman & Priya Sippy BBC News Arabic & BBC News, Port Sudan & London Share Save

AFP / Getty Images Black smoke has dominated the skyline in Port Sudan in the wake of the attacks

A massive increase in the price of water is just one consequence of a week of aerial attacks on the Red Sea city of Port Sudan. Once seen as a relatively safe haven from Sudan's devastating civil war, Port Sudan is now reeling from days of bombardment from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group. After six days of drone attacks, smoke is still rising from three fuel depots which were targeted. Rescue teams are gathered around the destroyed sites, but they are struggling to put the fires out. The conflict, which began as a struggle between the leaders of the RSF and the army more than two years ago, has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises and forced more than 12 million people from their homes. One of those who fled to Port Sudan is 26-year-old Mutasim, who did not want his second name published for safety reasons. The BBC spoke to him after he had waited hours for a water vendor to turn up. The vital commodity has become scarce. The explosions at the fuel depots have left Port Sudan without the diesel used to power the pumps that bring up the groundwater.

Mutasim told the BBC that whereas a day's supply of water cost him 2,000 Sudanese pounds ($3.30; £2.50) a week ago, he is now being charged five times that amount. It leaves him and the seven other members of his family without much water for cooking, cleaning and bathing. "Soon, we won't be able to afford it," he said explaining that he gets money from buying and selling basic goods in the market. Water is not the only challenge in Port Sudan. Daily life is going back to normal, markets and shops are open, but there are crowds of cars outside the city's petrol stations as people desperately wait for fuel. "It could take me five hours to get petrol," said Mutasim. It is a situation that many Sudanese have faced before, but not in this city.

Until last week, Port Sudan was one of the few places in the country that was considered protected from the worst of the civil war. "We came here two years ago from Omdurman," Mutasim said, referring to the city that sits on the other side of the River Nile from the capital, Khartoum. It cost the family their entire savings - $3,000 (£2,250) – to set up in a new place. "We were forced to leave our home by the RSF, so it was a relief to come here. Life was starting to go back to normal." "We were thinking about moving because it is no longer safe here, but it's so expensive - and where do we go?" Port Sudan has been experiencing blackouts for the past two weeks, which have been made worse by the latest attacks. "My auntie is over 70 years old, she is struggling with the heat and humidity because there is no electricity for fans at night," Mutasim said. "We can't sleep."

Hawa Mustafa is unsure what she will do next after Port Sudan was hit by the drone attacks

Hawa Mustafa, a teacher from el-Geneina in Darfur, in the west of the country, also sought refuge in Port Sudan. She has been living with her four children in a shelter for displaced people for over two years. She said this week's attacks left her "living in fear". "The drones came to us and we returned to a state of war and the lack of safety," she told the BBC. "The sounds of the drones and the anti-aircraft missiles remind me of the first days of the war in el-Geneina." Hawa lives without her husband, who has been unable to leave their home due to the deteriorating security situation. She is now responsible for her family. "I don't know where to go if things get worse in Port Sudan. I was planning to go to one of the neighbouring countries, but it seems that this dream will no longer come true." Another person living in the city, Mariam Atta, told the BBC that "life has changed completely". "We are struggling to cope," she said. "The fear is constant."

Since Sudan's civil war started in 2023, humanitarian agencies have depended on Port Sudan as a gateway to bring in aid, because of its port and the country's only functional international airport. It has been used by organisations such as the UN's World Food Programme to deliver food assistance. "Port Sudan is our main humanitarian hub," says Leni Kinzli, WFP spokesperson for Sudan. "In March, we had almost 20,000 metric tonnes of food distributed, and I would say definitely more than half of that came through Port Sudan," she told the BBC. The WFP has said that there is currently famine in 10 regions of the country, with 17 more at risk. Many aid agencies are now concerned these attacks could block the flow of aid, making the humanitarian situation even worse. "I think this is going to severely constrain the delivery of life-saving food and medical supplies, which will risk further deterioration of the already critical situation," Shashwat Saraf, country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the BBC. He added that while agencies will look for other routes into the country, it will be challenging. At night the city is quiet. Before the attacks, people would gather at the coast and some would watch football in local cafes. But the electricity blackout has left the city in the dark and residents are choosing to stay at home for security reasons.

Drone strikes have hit a major power station in Port Sudan on Tuesday, causing “a complete power outage” in the eastern Sudanese city, the country’s electricity provider told the BBC.

The barrage occurred as the paramilitary RSF continue to heighten attacks on Port Sudan, after launching their first strikes on the city this weekend.

The RSF unleashed drones on other key targets early Tuesday. One drone hit the civilian part of the city’s international airport, causing flights to be cancelled. Another drone hit an army base in the city centre and a third one struck a fuel depot near the port.

Witnesses say a hotel located close to the residence of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was also hit in the attack. There were no reported casualties.

Sudan Information Minister Khalid Aleiser visited the southern part of the port, where fuel tanks were reportedly hit. He slammed the United Arab Emirates, saying it was arming the RSF. The UAE rejected the accusation and condemned the attacks.

The RSF is targeting Port Sudan for the third day in a row. The city had previously been spared in Sudan's two-year war.

On Sunday, strikes hit the military part of the airport, followed by the targeting of fuel depots on Monday. In both cases, military sources blamed the RSF. The paramilitary has not commented on the attacks.

The United Nations has temporarily suspended all aid flights in and out of Port Sudan but maintains regular aid operations. "None of our offices, premises or warehouses have been impacted, and we continue to carry out our regular operations", said Farhan Haq, the UN deputy spokesperson.

The city was once seen as a safe haven for displaced people. It had become the de facto seat of the army-aligned government since the RSF first invaded Khartoum two years ago.

The city also welcomed hundreds of thousands of displaced people. The recent attacks are likely to worsen the humanitarian crisis in Sudan.

Two years into the war, the army has succeeded in pushing the RSF out of most of central Sudan, and the paramilitary has shifted tactics from ground incursions to drone attacks.

Port Sudan — The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have accused the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of launching a coordinated drone assault on the strategic Red Sea city of Port Sudan on Sunday. According to the SAF, 11 "suicide drones" targeted Osman Digna Air Base and other sites near Port Sudan International Airport in the early hours, striking a warehouse, a military installation, and several civilian areas.

Lt Gen Mahjoub Bishara, a Red Sea commander with the Sudanese Armed Forces, reportedly informed diplomats that most of the drones were intercepted by air defences, with some falling into the sea. One "strategic drone" is said to have penetrated those defences, causing material damage and minor injuries among personnel. No deaths have been reported.

SAF spokesperson Brig Gen Nabil Abdallah said the attack marked "a dangerous escalation" and warned it could "drag previously safe areas into the war."

Video clips circulating online appear to show plumes of black smoke rising from the vicinity of the airport.

The RSF has yet to issue a public statement regarding the attack.

Port Sudan had remained largely untouched by fighting until now, emerging as a refuge for UN agencies and over 500000 displaced civilians.

Following RSF's takeover of Khartoum early in the conflict, the city became the base for the de facto Sudan government.

Sudan's Foreign Ministry, based in Port Sudan, condemned the strikes as "terrorist" and accused RSF and its "regional sponsor", explicitly naming the United Arab Emirates, of fuelling the conflict.

The ministry claimed RSF was attempting to destroy infrastructure and destabilise the only remaining stronghold of state authority. It urged the international community to "pressure the UAE to stop supplying weapons, funding, and operational planning to RSF."

The drone attack on Port Sudan came just a day after a similar strike on Kassala Airport further east.

Many have speculated online that the drones used in the attack were reportedly China made loitering munitions resembling the Iranian Shahed 136 and believed to have been supplied by an external actor. They are said to have a 1500 km range and a 40 kg payload.

Radio Dabanga were however unable to independently verify what type of drone was used.

UAE response

UAE responded with a sharply worded statement today, rejecting any link to the attack and reiterating its support for peace efforts.

"The United Arab Emirates has condemned in the strongest terms the targeting of vital civilian facilities and critical infrastructure in Port Sudan and Kassala, denouncing such acts as a blatant violation of international humanitarian law," said the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA).

"The Ministry reaffirmed the UAE's unwavering position in calling for an immediate ceasefire, the protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure, and a peaceful resolution to the conflict."

It also urged all parties "to respect their obligations under international humanitarian law and their commitments under the Jeddah Declaration, and the mechanisms proposed by the Advancing Lifesaving and Peace in Sudan (ALPS) Group."

"The UAE calls for an end to the weaponisation and politicisation of humanitarian aid by the warring parties," the MoFA added, stressing its "firm dedication to supporting all efforts aimed at alleviating the humanitarian crisis."

Iran's Foreign Ministry condemned the recent drone strike on Port Sudan, with spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei expressing concern over continued attacks on civilian infrastructure and urging an immediate end to violence.

Citing the worsening humanitarian crisis marked by displacement and hunger, he called on the international community to act swiftly to halt hostilities and ensure aid reaches those in need.

Thousands of exhausted Sudanese refugees continue to flee fighting in search of safety in neighbouring Chad, aid teams said on Tuesday, as a third day of drone strikes ripped into the city of Port Sudan.

Nearly 20,000 people - mainly traumatized women and children - have reached Chad in the past two weeks, according to the UN refugee agency, UNCHR.

"Most arrived in Chad with nothing - no food, money or identification," said Magatte Guisse, UNHCR Representative in Chad. "Several wounded individuals, including children and elderly women, reportedly fell from vehicles during the chaotic escape."

Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world and already hosts 1.3 million refugees.

This includes nearly 800,000 people from Sudan since war broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in April 2023, after a breakdown in transition to civilian rule.

Heavy fighting in Sudan has devastated much of the country, likely killed tens of thousands and displaced almost nine million people, UN agencies say.

No food, no money

In Chad, the Tine border crossing in Wadi Fira Province has seen the sharpest spike in new arrivals, with more than 6,000 people in just two days,

Sudanese refugees are exposed to robbery and extortion at checkpoints - and many have also witnessed men being killed, women and girls sexually abused, and homes burned to the ground.

The refugee agency reported that armed groups have extorted, robbed or sexually assaulted around 76 per cent of the newly arrived refugees.

A nation of 19 million people where resources are already strained, Chad is overstretched and needs "increased solidarity and immediate funding, to ensure these vulnerable populations receive the protection and assistance they need, now".

Renewed attacks on Port Sudan

In a related development, a third day of drone strikes hit the international airport and a power station in Port Sudan, the UN's humanitarian hub for coordinating aid operations across Sudan.

The city is the current seat of government and until this weekend had been largely spared from the violence that is ongoing in Khartoum, Darfur and elsewhere. Thousands of people fleeing the war have also sought shelter in Port Sudan.

"Port Sudan airport is a lifeline for humanitarian operations, serving as the primary entry point for aid personnel, medical supplies and other lifesaving relief that is coming into Sudan," said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN aid coordination office, OCHA. The airport is "immensely important", he told journalists in Geneva.

According to reports, the Red Sea city suffered a complete power outage after drone strikes hit a large power station on Tuesday. Other strikes reportedly hit an army base in the city centre, a fuel depot and a hotel close to the airport, which is located near to the presidential palace.

These attacks have increased the "already severe" lack of aid access and delivery challenges facing humanitarian teams across the country, explained Mr. Laerke, adding that such violence is prohibited under international humanitarian law.

It is widely believed that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are responsible for the attacks. No UN facilities or operations have been impacted but UN Humanitarian Air Service flights in and out of the city have been paused.

Port Sudan — Port Sudan endured a third consecutive day of drone strikes today, targeting key civilian and military infrastructure in what officials described as a calculated assault on the country's administrative capital. Explosions hit Port Sudan International Airport, the main power station, fuel depots, and several military and government-linked sites.

The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) blamed the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), alleging that the drones were supplied by the UAE. El Basha Tebeig, advisor to RSF Commander Mohamed 'Hemedti' Dagalo, posted a cryptic message on his official X account (formerly Twitter) earlier today, linking the strikes to a previous attack on Tel Aviv Airport.

Sunday's attacks damaged the airport and Osman Digna Air Base; Monday's hit vital fuel depots. Tuesday's strikes ignited new fires and sent smoke across the city.

The Civil Aviation Authority grounded all flights between 10:00 a.m. and 17:00 p.m., with EgyptAir cancelling all services. The national electricity company confirmed the power station was struck, cutting supply to parts of the city.

The main fuel depot and four storage sites were destroyed. Civil Defence is struggling to contain the blaze, and a request for help was sent to Saudi Arabia.

Fuel shortages have spread to Kassala, with queues forming at stations. A dialysis centre in Port Sudan cut treatment hours and asked patients to arrive earlier.

Drones hit Kassala's airport for the third time in as many days, while northern Sudan's Meroe Dam was damaged in a separate attack on Monday night.

Egypt condemned the strikes, warning they threaten ceasefire efforts. Rebel factions meeting in eastern Sudan said the war was "entering a dangerous phase" and vowed to defend the region.

UN condemns the attacks

In a press release circulated today, UN Resident and Sudan's Humanitarian Coordinator of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Aid (OCHA), Clementine Nkweta-Salami, expressed shock at the escalating drone strikes.

She warned that damage to civilian infrastructure such as the Port Sudan airport, a key aid corridor, could deepen humanitarian suffering across the country.

"The airport is a lifeline for humanitarian operations, and fuel from Port Sudan is critical to dispatching aid across Sudan," she said. Disruption to supply chains, she noted, could drive up the cost of basic goods and worsen an already dire crisis.

"These are serious violations of international humanitarian law," she added, calling on all parties to the conflict to "cease hostilities and ensure the protection of civilians."

Displaced people reaching Tawila locality. They mainly come from El Fasher and surrounding camps like Zamzam and Abu Shok and report extreme violence, repeated shelling, skyrocketing commodity prices and food shortages as the main reasons to move.

press release

Three weeks on from the large-scale ground offensive by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on Zamzam camp, Sudan, in early April 2025, reports of intensified fighting in El-Fasher continue, and more displaced people are arriving in Tawila, North Darfur state.1 People have been arriving in Tawila in a vulnerable state; many are suffering from malnutrition, and others were injured during the attack on Zamzam camp. Médecins Sans Frontières' (MSF's) emergency and nutrition service at the hospital in Tawila has been overwhelmed.

"They came with their machine guns. They attacked and killed people - including children. They burnt our house, with everything we had inside. They raped the women. They killed, they looted," says Mariam*, who reached Tawila three days after the attack on Zamzam took place. "Even before the attack, people had died of thirst and of starvation because of the siege that had been imposed on Zamzam for the past year. Everything was so expensive and so unaffordable in the end."

Mariam* arrived with her mother, her sisters and their children- a household of 20 people. All of them now spend their days squeezed against each other under the makeshift shelter they built with a few branches and a piece of fabric.

"Here, there is no food. A few people in Tawila shared a bit of millet flour with us, which we used to make porridge. This is how we have survived so far: begging," she says. "We get the water from a tank, but they only let us fill one jerrycan per family, and we are 20 in ours. We only have one blanket for all of us."

Since 12 April, when people first began reaching Tawila from Zamzam, the areas surrounding the town have been completely transformed, with tens of thousands of people now estimated to be living in makeshift shelters in fields that were totally uninhabited just a few weeks ago.

"For four days now, we have been staying here as you see us, with nothing: no walls, no roof," says Ibrahim*, who fled Zamzam on foot with 11 of his family members. He carried one of his children on his shoulders and another on his back for five days. It's the fourth time in ten years he has been displaced in similar circumstances. He described how soldiers entered people's homes, brought them outside and opened fire. Three of his brothers were killed like this. On his way to Tawila, he got looted and witnessed people being beaten so harshly that they could no longer move.

"Under this tree, it is so crowded, we're lacking water, or shelter... there is nothing to eat, everyone is hungry," he says. "We're getting some food from the community kitchens. Sometimes, we manage to get some rice when they distribute the meals, but if we don't, we must wait until the next day to eat something. For water, we go to a borehole, but there are so many people, and we have to wait hours to be able to drink."

A handful of organisations are present in Tawila, but the number of people in need of assistance far exceed the capacity to respond. MSF teams have set up two health posts at the main arrival sites to provide the newcomers with water and immediate nutrition and medical support. We are also referring critical patients to Tawila local hospital, where MSF has been working since October 2024.

Tiphaine Salmon, MSF's head nurse, was working in the Tawila hospital on 12 April, the day people began arriving with serious injuries.

"The emergency room was overwhelmed," she says. "Over the first few days, the number of patients in the hospital almost doubled. At one point, we had four patients in a bed because we did not have enough space."

"A lot of people had gunshot wounds and blast injuries - we've treated 779 people over the past three weeks, including 138 children. 187 of all the patients were severe cases," says Salmon. "The youngest I saw was a seven-month-old baby with a bullet wound that went under his chin and into his shoulder. We also received patients as young as one day old suffering from dehydration. Many children arrived without their parents - and many parents were searching desperately for their children."

At the same time, MSF teams in the hospital witnessed an explosion of admissions in our intensive therapeutic feeding centre, which treats children under five-year-old suffering from severe acute malnutrition in addition of other comorbidities. In the week following the initial influx, admissions increased almost tenfold from an average of six or seven per week, to more than 60. They were mostly children from Zamzam, showing how desperate the nutrition situation was in the famine-stricken camp.

To make the situation even worse, a suspected measles outbreak began in Tawila in March. In the hospital, MSF treated more than 900 suspected measles cases since early February, with more than 300 people in such a severe condition that they required hospitalisation. This led our teams to launch a large-scale vaccination campaign in the city on the first week of April, reaching 18,000 children under five. But one week after the massive influx of people from Zamzam began, our teams saw several suspected cases among children who had just arrived.

Malnutrition and measles, in such sites with a highly dense population and poor hygiene conditions, can be an especially deadly combination for young children.

MSF is continuing to scale-up our intervention in Tawila. On top of carrying out hundreds of medical consultations per day, we have also donated dry food to local community kitchens, enabling them to prepare and distribute more than 16,000 meals per day. We are providing 100,000 litres of clean water daily and we have additional plans to construct 300 latrines.

People's needs remain immense and far exceed our capacity to respond. Although other actors have also mobilised, and a first mass food distribution has taken place, the humanitarian response still needs to be urgently and rapidly scaled up. We urge UN agencies to substantially increase their presence on the ground so that they can coordinate a response of a magnitude that will meet the ever-growing needs.

Title: Sudan: Drone Attacks On Port Sudan - the Conflict Risks Spreading to Neighboring Regions

Khartoum — The war in Sudan has escalated with the bombing of Port Sudan, the stronghold of the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) under the command of General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

Today, May 6, RSF drones under the command of Mohamed Hamdan "Hemeti" Dagalo attacked the important Sudanese port city for the third consecutive day. The attacks targeted the civilian area of the airport, a fuel depot, the main military base in the city center, and a hotel.

The first attack took place on Sunday, May 4, when the military part of the airport was targeted.

Although there were no casualties, the attack caused damage to several warehouses and facilities. The May 4 attack came just two days after a similar airstrike against facilities in the city of Kassala.

Port Sudan has become increasingly strategically important since the Sudanese government, diplomatic missions, international organizations, and major companies relocated there after the RSF seized control of large parts of the capital, Khartoum. The attacks on Port Sudan have provoked strong reactions from the Sudanese government, which has indicated that the RSF is supported by key international allies such as Kenya, which recently hosted a summit sponsored by Dagalo to form an alternative government to the one led by General al-Burhan (see Fides, 19/2/2025).

But the United Arab Emirates is particularly in the sights of al-Burhan, who is accused of supplying the RSF with the drones used in the recent attacks. Just yesterday, May 5, the International Court of Justice dismissed the Sudanese government's lawsuit against the United Arab Emirates, accusing it of complicity in the genocide in Darfur (see Fides, 11/4/2025). The court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction over the case because the UAE had reservations regarding Article 9 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.

Sudanese government officials suspect that the bombs that hit Port Sudan did not come from rebel-held Sudanese territories, but from Bosaso in Somalia's Puntland, where the Emirates have established a key logistical center from which they supply the RSF with weapons and ammunition. According to some sources, the Emirati base in Bosaso (protected by sophisticated Israeli-made radar) was hit on May 3 by drones launched by the Sudanese army. The latest attacks on Port Sudan are therefore in retaliation for the May 3 attack, in which a cargo plane chartered by the Emirates carrying Colombian mercenaries and weapons was allegedly hit at the moment of take-off to Nyala in Darfur (western Sudan), the RSF stronghold.

The Sudanese conflict therefore threatens to spread to neighboring countries and actors outside Africa.

CAIRO (AP) — Umm al-Kheir Bakheit was 13 when she arrived at Zamzam Camp in the early 2000s, fleeing the janjaweed, the infamous Arab militias terrorizing Sudan’s Darfur region. She grew up, married and had three children in the camp.

Now 31, Bakheit fled Zamzam as the janjaweed’s descendants — a paramilitary force called the Rapid Support Forces — stormed into the camp and went on a three-day rampage, killing at least 400 people, after months of starving its population with a siege.

Bakheit and a dozen other residents and aid workers told The Associated Press that RSF fighters gunned down men and women in the streets, beat and tortured others and raped and sexually assaulted women and girls.

The April 11 attack was the worst ever suffered by Zamzam, Sudan’s largest displacement camp, in its 20 years of existence. Once home to some 500,000 residents, the camp has been virtually emptied. The paramilitaries burned down large swaths of houses, markets and other buildings.

“It’s a nightmare come true,” Bakheit said. “They attacked mercilessly.”

Months of famine

The attack on Zamzam underscored that atrocities have not ended in Sudan’s 2-year-old war, even as the RSF has suffered heavy setbacks, losing ground recently to the military in other parts of the country.

Throughout the war, the RSF has been accused by residents and rights groups of mass killings and rapes in attacks on towns and cities, particularly in Darfur. Many of RSF’s fighters originated from the janjaweed, who became notorious for atrocities in the early 2000s against people identifying as East or Central African in Darfur.

“Targeting civilians and using rape as a war weapon and destroying full villages and mass killing, all that has been the reality of the Sudan war for two years,” said Marion Ramstein, MSF emergency field coordinator in North Darfur.

Zamzam Camp was established in 2004 to house people driven from their homes by janjaweed attacks. Located just south of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, it swelled over the years to cover an area 8 kilometers (5 miles) long by about 3 kilometers (2 miles) wide.

In the spring of 2024, the RSF clamped a siege around Zamzam as it moved against el-Fasher, one of the last strongholds of the Sudanese military in Darfur.

Many have died of starvation under the siege, Bakheit and others said. “For too long, there was no option but to eat grass and tree leaves,” she said.

Famine was declared in the camp in August after RSF attacks forced the U.N. and aid groups to pull out of Zamzam. A comprehensive death toll from the famine is not known.

Ahlam al-Nour, a 44-year-old mother of five, said her youngest child, a 3-year-old, died of severe malnutrition in December.

The RSF has repeatedly claimed Zamzam and nearby Abu Shouk Camp were used as bases by the military and its allied militias. It said in a statement that it took control of the camp on April 11 to “secure civilians and humanitarian workers.” It denied its fighters targeted civilians. The RSF did not reply to AP’s questions on the attack.

‘The janjaweed are coming’

Bakheit, who lived on the southern edge of Zamzam, said she heard loud explosions and heavy gunfire around 2 a.m. April 11. The RSF started with heavy shelling, and people panicked as the night sky lit up and houses burst into flames, Bakheit said.

By sunrise, the RSF-led fighters broke into her area, storming houses, kicking residents out and seizing valuables, Bakheit and others said. They spoke of sexual harassment and rape of young women and girls by RSF fighters.

“The children were screaming, ‘The janjaweed are coming’,” Bakheit said.

About two dozen women who fled to the nearby town of Tawila reported that they were raped during the attack, said Ramstein, who was in Tawila at the time. She said the number is likely much higher because many women are too ashamed to report rapes.

“We’re talking about looting. We’re talking about beating. We’re talking about killing, but also about a lot of rape,” she said.

The paramilitaries rounded up hundreds of people, including women and children. Bakheit said fighters whipped, beat, insulted and sexually harassed her in front of her children as they drove her family from their home.

She said she saw houses burning and at least five bodies in the street, including two women and a boy, the ground around them soaked in blood.

The fighters gathered Bakheit and about 200 other people in an open area and interrogated them, asking about anyone fighting for the military and its allied militias.

“They tortured us,” said al-Nour, who was among them.

Al-Nour and Bakheit said they saw RSF fighters shoot two young men in the head during the interrogation. They shot a third man in the leg and he lay bleeding and screaming, they said.

One video shared online by RSF paramilitaries showed fighters wearing RSF uniforms by nine bodies lying motionless on the ground. A fighter says he is inside Zamzam and that they would kill people “like this,” pointing to the bodies on the ground.

Much of the camp was burned

The RSF rampage, which also targeted Abu Shouk Camp north of el-Fasher, went on for days.

The paramilitaries destroyed Zamzam’s only functioning medical center, killing nine workers from Relief International. They killed at least 23 people at a religious school, mostly young students studying the Quran, according to the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees in Darfur.

Much of the south and east of the camp was burned to the ground, the General Coordination said.

Satellite imagery from April 16 showed thick black smoke rising from several active fires in the camp. At least 1.7 square kilometers (0.65 square miles) appeared to have been burned down between April 10-16, said a report by the Yale School of Public Health’s Humanitarian Research Lab, which analyzed and published the imagery. That is about 10% of the camp’s area.

The imagery showed vehicles around the camp and at its main access points, which HRL said were probably RSF checkpoints controlling entry and exit.

By April 14, only about 2,100 people remained in the camp, according to the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.

An arduous journey

After being detained for three hours, Bakheit, al-Nour and dozens of other women and children were released by the paramilitaries.

They walked for hours under the burning summer sun. Bakheit and al-Nour said that as they passed through the camp, they went by burning houses, the destroyed main market and bodies of men, women, children in the streets, some of them charred.

They joined an exodus of others fleeing Zamzam and heading to the town of Tawila, 64 kilometers (40 miles) west of El Fasher. Al-Nour said she saw at least three people who died on the road, apparently from exhaustion and the effects of starvation and dehydration.

“The janjaweed, once again, kill and torture us,” Bakheit said. “Like my mother did about 20 years ago, I had no option but to take my children and leave.”

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — More than 300 civilians were killed in two days of intense fighting in Sudan’s conflict-wracked Darfur region, the U.N. humanitarian agency reported Monday, as the African country’s brutal civil war nears the two-year mark.

The attacks launched by Sudan’s notorious paramilitary group on two famine-hit camps for displaced people in North Darfur and its nearby capital on Friday and Saturday were initially reported to have left more than 100 dead, including 20 children and nine aid workers, according to a U.N. official.

But the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA, reported the much higher death toll Monday, citing local sources that were not identified. The Associated Press could not independently verify the numbers due to the conditions and communications on the ground.

Sudan plunged into conflict on April 15, 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region. Since then, at least 24,000 people have been tallied as being killed, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is far higher.

The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, known as the RSF, carried out the recent attacks after the Sudanese military late last month regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war.

The war has created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis and worst displacement crisis, and it has led to Sudan becoming the only country in the world experiencing famine.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said OCHA has received reports of mass casualties and large-scale displacement following the recent fighting in and around the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk displacement camps, as well as North Darfur’s capital, El Fasher, the only capital in Darfur that the RSF doesn’t control. North Darfur is one of five states in the Darfur region.

“Preliminary figures from local sources indicate that more than 300 civilians have been killed, including 10 humanitarian personnel from the NGO Relief International who lost their lives while operating one of the last functioning health centers in Zamzam camp,” Dujarric said.

The escalation in the fighting came ahead of a conference in London to spotlight the war’s anniversary on Tuesday organized by Britain, the European Union, Germany and France, where more than 20 foreign ministers are expected along with representatives of global organizations.

Dujarric said the United Nations wants the conference to see Sudan’s “neighbors and the international community move in unity of purpose towards peace instead of fueling the conflict.”

Also Tuesday, the U.N. Security Council has scheduled emergency closed consultations on Sudan.

The U.N. migration agency said Monday the RSF attacks in Zamzam camp have displaced between 60,000 to 80,000 families in the past two days. The majority of the families remain within El Fasher, which is under military control but has been besieged by the RSF for over a year.

Mamadou Dian Balde, the U.N. refugee office’s regional director, said in a video press conference with U.N. correspondents that “massive violations of human rights” have forced almost 13 million Sudanese to flee their homes, including 4 million who fled to other countries. Most fled to Sudan’s immediate neighbors, but more than 200,000 have gone to Libya and about 70,000 to Uganda, he said.

Balde said the U.N. refugee agency’s appeal for $1.8 billion to help the millions of refugees and their host nations is only 10% funded. He warned that if it doesn’t get more money, people will move toward southern Africa, east Africa, the Gulf countries and Europe.

“We really hope that tomorrow’s event in London will also show greater support for the Sudanese brothers and sisters who have been displaced,” Balde said.

Tens of thousands of Sudanese driven from their homes by conflict are now returning, despite war still raging in some parts of the country.

They set off on the journey, even though they don't know what they'll find in their homeland, wrecked and still embroiled in a two-year-old war.

But they are hoping for some stability after the military recaptured the capital Khartoum and other areas from its rival, the Rapid Support Forces.

Nearly 13 million people fled their homes, with some 4 million streaming into neighbouring countries and the rest sheltering elsewhere in Sudan.

A relatively small portion of the refugees are returning so far, but the numbers are accelerating.

Some 1.5 million Sudanese fled to Egypt during the war, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

In Cairo, travel agency coordinator Walid Abu el-Seid says there has been a noticeable uptick in travellers booking trips back to Sudan.

Hundreds of Sudanese take the two or three buses each day for southern Egypt, the first leg in the journey home.

According to the International Organization for Migration, some 123,000 Sudanese returned from Egypt since the start of the year, including nearly 50,000 so far in April, double the month before.

It estimates that some 400,000 internally displaced Sudanese have gone back to their homes in the Khartoum area, neighbouring Gezira province and southeast Sennar province.

But many of the returnees are finding their neighbourhoods shattered left shattered by fighting, often with no electricity and scarce food, water and services.

Still, Huzaifa Al-Mubarak was determined to go back.

About to board a bus in Egypt's capital Cairo, he insisted that there were "no fears in Khartoum... It is safe and secure."

The battle for power between the military and Rapid Support Forces caused one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.

At least 20,000 people were killed, according to the United Nations, though the figure is likely higher.

Aid remains limited and the scale of needs far exceeds available resources, according to UNHCR officials.

In the Sudanese civil war, mortar bombs - like the ones investigated by the FRANCE 24 Observers team - have largely been used to target civilian infrastructures. Fighters with the Rapid Support Forces, the militia that is fighting against the Sudanese army in the ongoing civilian war, have frequently fired mortar bombs on refugee camps around the city of El-Fasher in Darfur. Montage of images showing Sudanese fighters firing mortar shells and the damage caused by these munitions.

Recap of the first three articles in our series: Through videos and exclusive access to documents, the FRANCE 24 Observers team was able to reveal that mortar shells found in the Sudanese desert were manufactured by the Bulgarian company Dunarit, and then sold on to the Emirati firm International Golden Group. The firm is known for diverting weapons illicitly to countries under international embargo. The supply chain of munitions we investigated ended up in Libya and finally Sudan as part of a convoy that included Colombian mercenaries.

In the videos they filmed on November 21, 2024, fighters with the Joint Forces say that the weapons they had just seized were en route to the Rapid Support Forces, a rebel group that has been fighting the Sudanese army in a brutal civil war since April 2023.

We needed to verify this information. Were the weapons manufactured by the Bulgarian company Dunarit actually en route to the RSF? Would they be used in the civil war?

'The United Arab Emirates is providing all of their support to the Rapid Support Forces'

Suliman Baldo is a Sudanese researcher and the founder of the Sudanese think tank Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker . He explains that many armed groups in Darfur , which are now allied to the Sudanese Army as part of the Joint Forces, also have benefited from Emirati support in the past.

When they were fighting against the government in Khartoum, which ended with the Juba peace agreement in 2020, the Sudan Liberation Movement [Editor’s note: one of the armed groups that is part of the Joint Forces] was based in Libya, in areas under the control of General Haftar. The same goes for most of the other Darfur-based armed groups. Haftar’s regime was supported by the United Arab Emirates so, indirectly, the Darfur armed movements were also allies of the Emirates. They benefited from weapons that the Emirates sent to Haftar’s army. When these movements left Libya and moved back into Sudan after the Juba agreements, they took with them goodbye presents that included lots of material like weapons from the UAE . All of that ended when the war started in April 2023. Now it is really simple. The United Arab Emirates and Haftar’s regime provide all their support to the Rapid Support Forces.

The mortar bombs manufactured by Dunarit have ended up in Sudanese battlefields

Fighters with the RSF often film themselves in battle, sometimes while carrying out extrajudicial killings and heinous acts of violence towards civilians, as we showed in an investigation published back in 2023.

Our attention was caught by a video filmed in September 2023. Several Sudanese social media accounts said that it was filmed in Omdurman, a city connected to Khartoum. The footage shows a man firing mortar bombs. The phone that is filming him seems to be propped up on some other mortar bombs — and, in the video, you can clearly see the numbers stamped on them. These numbers indicate that they were manufactured by the Bulgarian company Dunarit.

The phone used to film this video was propped on a 120 mm mortar bomb. The bomb has the number 46 in two circles stamped on it: this identifies it as a bomb made by the Bulgarian company Dunarit. The fighter who appears in the videos is firing the same mortar bombs, which proves that the bombs made by Dunarit in the European Union have already been used in combat in Sudan.

In this screengrab, taken from the video of the man firing mortar bombs, you can see two details on the mortar bombs. The first is the number 46 surrounded by two circles (marked in red). This is Dunarit’s symbol as you can see in archive photos taken from their website (bottom left). The second important detail comes from the 6-digit number, which you can partially see (marked in blue). This number ends with 19, which indicates that the bomb was made in 2019, like the weapons filmed by Sudanese fighters on November 21. © The FRANCE 24 Observers

Initially, it is hard to know which side both the person who took the video and the militant seen firing the mortar bomb, are on. They aren’t wearing recognisable uniforms.

“These are typical militia fighters,” says Suliman Baldo. “Half dressed in civilian clothes with pieces of military uniforms… they are even wearing sandals!”

However, it is possible to find out more about who these men are affiliated with by looking into the TikTok account of the person who filmed the footage, which we can find thanks to the username displayed on the video. The video has since been deleted from the platform because it violated the conditions of use, but the account is still active.

In this post, the person behind the account complains that TikTok has deleted his content. This allows us to confirm that he is indeed the person who filmed the video showing the man firing Bulgarian mortar bombs - we see a tiny vignette of it in the screengrab. © TikTok

This TikTok user follows a large number of accounts that belong to fighters from the Rapid Support Forces, or share propaganda about the RSF and its leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti.

They often post images of themselves wearing a sand-coloured uniform common to fighters with this militia, and videos glorifying RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti. © The FRANCE 24 Observers

Another video, posted on the account on September 12, 2023, shows a child standing in front of a restaurant reciting phrases he’s clearly memorised. The person filming praises the child.

In this video posted on TikTok by the same man who shared a video of a fighter firing a Dunarit mortar bomb, you can see a child reciting slogans while the man filming praises him. According to several Sudanese sources who spoke to our team, these slogans are popular with the Rapid Support Forces. For their own security, we anonymised the two children who appear in the video.

The FRANCE 24 Observers team showed this video to 11 Sudanese people. Out of the 11, ten said that the man in the video was an RSF fighter. One of them, who requested anonymity, said:

It looks like a child is trying to flatter the RSF fighter who is filming him by reciting a poem. He says, “We are going to burn the headquarters,” which seems to be a reference to the army’s headquarters. Then, he says: “the state is us, even if you don’t agree,” which is a defiant phrase. At the end, the man filming shows his approval.

The bombs manufactured by Dunarit were therefore present on the battlefield in Sudan’s civil war long before fighters with the Joint Forces filmed the convoy they intercepted in November 2024.

The 6-digit number visible on the Dunarit bombs fired by militia back in September 2023 indicates that they were manufactured in 2019, just like those that Dunarit sold to International Golden Group. The documents that we viewed indicated that the sale also included 120 mm bombs, like the ones we see being fired in the video from September 2023.

Mortar bombs, a death trap for civilians

The transfer of Bulgarian weapons to Sudan constitutes a violation of the arms embargo that the European Union has had in place since 1994.

“Moreover, if these weapons were transported through Libya , that means that the people who transported them violated United Nations weapons embargoes twice over — once when they brought them into Libyan territory and then again when they were transferred to Sudan,” commented a former specialist in the region for the United Nations, who wanted to remain anonymous.

However, this supply chain providing the RSF with European-made weapons not only breaks international law, it also has catastrophic consequences.

Mortar bombs of the same calibre as those that Dunarit sold International Golden Group are regularly used in deadly bombings on Sudanese civilians, including by the RSF.

'If you fire a mortar bomb in a zone where there are civilians, you have a serious risk of hitting them'

Mike Lewis is a specialist in armed conflicts and a former member of the UN Panel of Experts on Sudan.

There are two important things to know about mortars. First, they're an indirect fire weapon, so they are used to fire at something that you can't necessarily see. Secondly, they are relatively imprecise weapons because they are unguided indirect fire weapons. So if you fire mortars in an area where there are civilians, you have a very serious risk of hitting a civilian target. There has been a long history in Sudan of using weapons like mortar rounds or artillery rounds in areas where there are concentrations of civilians. Since the start of the civil war in 2023, there have been instances in which mortar rounds have been recovered in marketplaces, hospitals, and refugee camps.

In the video below, which certain local accounts on X and Facebook have said was filmed in the town of Omdurman, four RSF fighters fire a 120 mm mortar bomb at an unknown target. This bomb was not made by Dunarit, but it is the same calibre as the ones that you can see in the September 2023 video featuring two RSF fighters firing bombs manufactured by this Bulgarian company.

In this video, which was posted on social media in early December 2024, four men wearing RSF uniforms fire a 120mm mortar bomb while dancing a dance that has been popularised amongst Sudanese fighters on TikTok. The video was filmed in Omdurman, near Khartoum. The RSF fighters seem to be firing from the courtyard of a civilian building.

This footage was filmed around December 9, 2024, when violent combat was taking place between the army and the RSF in Omdurman.

In the days after this video was posted online, a number of Sudanese organisations and media outlets reported that civilians in Omdurman had been killed in “artillery bombings” carried out by the RSF, a phrase often used to describe mortar strikes. A video from December 10, 2024, reports the death of an entire bus load of civilians when their bus was hit by a projectile fired by the Rapid Support Forces.

In this video, filmed from a car window, you can see a crowd gathering around the burnt-out carcass of a vehicle. There are bodies wrapped in sheets on the ground. Those who shared this video said that it showed a bus that had been hit by a projectile fired by the RSF in Omdurman on December 10, 2024.

A number of social media accounts posited that the video showing the RSF fighters firing mortar bombs in Omdurman was linked to the bus that was hit. However, our team was unable to independently establish that the bus had indeed been hit by a projectile fired by the RSF.

A series of mortar bomb massacres in Darfur carried out by the RSF

The RSF has also been known to use mortar bombs to directly target civilian gathering places outside of active combat zones. Many of these massacres have taken place in Darfur, a region in western Sudan, where the RSF has been accused of genocide against the non-Arab population by the military-led Sudanese government . The 2024 report by the UN Panel of Experts on the Sudan documents one of these massacres, an attack on the capital of West Darfur, El Geneina, between April and November 2023.

The Panel included a photo of remnants of ammunition in El Geneina, taken in May 2023. You can see an unexploded mortar of the same calibre as the ones that Dunarit sold to the International Golden Group. There is, however, no indication that the weapons shown here were manufactured in Bulgaria. © UN Panels of Experts on the Sudan

More recently, the RSF deliberately targeted civilians in El-Fasher, another town in Darfur that has been under siege by the RSF since the beginning of the civil war. On the outskirts of El-Fasher, there are a number of refugee camps, home to many people who have fled violence in other parts of Darfur. The RSF regularly attacks these camps.

During these attacks, the fighters regularly and indiscriminately bomb the camps, with mortar shells. That’s what happened on December 31, 2024, in Abu Shouk , located to the northwest of El-Fasher. Posts by local humanitarian organisations show homes and a school in the camp that were bombed by the RSF. At least one person died in the bombings, according to a local humanitarian organisation called Abu Shouk Emergency Room.

Photos shared by local media outlet the Ayin Network show that mortar bombs were used in this attack. It isn’t possible to identify the manufacturer of these weapons in this case.

The same thing occurred on January 24, 2025. A total of 117 bombs hit the camp, falling from early in the morning to late at night. A total of eight people were killed and dozens of others were wounded, according to the account of Abu Shouk Emergency Room.

This was likely ammunition from Serbia, as documented by OSINT X account @FaisalElsheikh.

'The place where the bombings are the most deadly is the last market in the camp'

On February 20, Mohammed Adam, who works with the Abu Shouk Emergency Room, provided our team with a terrifying portrait of life inside the camp.

Now, the soldiers with the army have advanced a bit and the RSF had to retreat to seven to 10 kilometres from the camp. They keep firing at us because you can access the military camp through Abu Shouk camp. That’s why the RSF keeps firing at civilians with heavy weapons and mortar bombs – to force them to move elsewhere and free up the passage to the army’s camp. The RSF bombs public buildings, markets, and hospitals, so that civilians can’t access healthcare, find food, or go back to work. The aim is to force them to flee to safer areas, to empty out the place. The place where the bombs are most deadly is the last market operating in the camp. People started using this market after the bigger market closed. When a mortar bomb hit the market recently, a number of people died and dozens were injured. All in all, since the start of the civil war, more than 500 people have died in our care. And that’s not even counting the people who die instantly during the bombings. Those people are brought directly to the cemetery, we don’t even have numbers for them but we think there have been at least 300. We are in the process of gathering all the names so we can publish them on our Facebook page.

Mike Lewis says the large number of civilian casualties isn’t surprising considering the technical characteristics of mortar bombs and a well-known history of both the RSF and the army bombing civilian zones.

“In terms of the foreseeable civilian harms that could arise from supplying these kinds of weapons to a force like the RSF, it's very obvious that this kind of harm was predictable,” he said.

While this investigation was conducted, the RSF launched new assaults on camps around El-Fasher, including Abu Shouk and Zamzam camps. The death toll from these attacks, still provisional, is extremely high: at least 100 people, including 20 children, would have been killed according to the UN.

International Golden Group keeps quiet

Our team contacted International Golden Group by phone and email. They did not respond to our interview requests. It is thus impossible to know if they are aware that the weapons they bought in 2019 have been transferred to Sudan.

International Golden Group remains very active. It was a key participant in the IDEX 2025 expo, a massive arms and defence technology sales exhibition that was held in Abu Dhabi in February this year.

In the last article in our investigation, we take a closer look at what went on at this year's IDEX expo while also exposing parts of the underbelly of the global weapons trade. It turns out that International Golden Group has a number of partnerships with French and European companies, despite the company’s well-known history of diverting weapons to zones under international embargo.

This is the fourth article of a five-part investigation.

OVERVIEW

Sudan faces an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, with 30.4 million people—over half the population—requiring assistance in 2025. Among them are 16 million children, representing the nation’s future.

The people in need comprises 14.3 million non-hosting residents (47 per cent), 8.9 million internally displaced persons (29 per cent), 6.4 million host community members (21 per cent), and 0.89 million refugees (3 per cent). Over half of those affected are children, and 50 per cent are women and girls.

Acute food insecurity has more than tripled since the pre-conflict period, affecting over half the population. Famine conditions have been confirmed in parts of North Darfur, with millions more at risk in conflict-affected areas, including Darfur, Kordofan, and Khartoum.

Since April 2023, over 12 million people have been displaced, including 8.8 million within Sudan and over 3 million fleeing to neighbouring countries. This marks one of the largest global displacement crises in less than two years.

The conflict has devastated the lives of 24 million children, leaving 17 million out of school and fuelling a generational catastrophe. Gender-based violence has reached alarming levels, disproportionately affecting women and children, with over 12.2 million at risk—an 80 per cent increase from the previous year. Urgent action is needed to de-escalate the conflict, enable unrestricted humanitarian access and address famine risks. The humanitarian community urges safe and unimpeded access to affected areas, highlighting that over 110 aid workers have been killed, injured or abducted since the conflict began.

The 2025 Humanitarian Needs Response Plan aims to support nearly 20.9 million of the most vulnerable individuals, including women, children and displaced populations, with life-saving aid, protection, and access to basic services. It seeks $4.2 billion —equivalent to $200 per person for the entire year, or 50 cents per day — underscoring the urgent need for unprecedented international support.

Joint Statement - Two Years of War, Starvation and Global Failure: The World Must Act Now for Sudan

Joint Statement - Two Years of War, Starvation and Global Failure: The World Must Act Now for Sudan

Two years of war in Sudan have created a humanitarian catastrophe without parallel. Over 30 million people – nearly 65 percent of Sudan’s population – now need urgent assistance to survive. Attacks on civilians are relentless. Women and girls endure systemic sexual violence. The reported use of rape as a weapon of war paints one of the conflict’s darkest pictures. Meanwhile, lifesaving aid is being deliberately blocked as famine spreads – pushing entire communities towards starvation – and the looming rainy season threatens to flood critical transportation routes and further reduce access to communities in urgent need.

While the international community has taken steps to alleviate suffering, these remain too slow, too timid, and dangerously inadequate.

Half of Sudan’s population faces severe hunger. The stories that our teams and partners share with us must be a wake-up call to the world: A father so desperate that he tried to sell his three children, hoping someone who could feed them would buy them; families forced to survive on grass and leaves because there’s simply nothing else to eat. These are not isolated cases, but the brutal reality for millions living in conflict-affected states.

Over 3.7 million refugees – mostly women and children – have fled to neighboring countries in search of food and safety, only to face equally dire conditions. Exhausted and destitute, Sudanese refugees arriving in Chad, South Sudan, and beyond find overcrowded camps, scarce resources, and a humanitarian system stretched to its absolute limits. The region is at a tipping point, with tensions now flaring in South Sudan, Chad and Ethiopia.

The world’s failure to fund humanitarian action in Sudan has now become the biggest obstacle to saving lives. Only ten percent of this year’s $4.1 billion appeal to assist 20.9 million people in Sudan has been secured. Efforts to support refugees and returnees in neighbouring countries also remain critically underfunded. This catastrophic gap is forcing Sudanese local responders to shut down life-saving communal kitchens and mobile clinics. Yet they are the backbone of the humanitarian response, saving lives daily by reaching those in the greatest need with food, water, and medical care.

The upcoming ministerial conference on Sudan taking place in the United Kingdom must be a turning point. World leaders should move beyond rhetoric and take immediate, concrete action to end the conflict, protect civilians, ensure aid reaches those who need it, and stop the expansion of famine conditions. This requires facing a brutal truth: when funding dries up, people don’t just suffer—they die. Humanitarian organisations, including local responders, need resources now – not tomorrow, not after another round of talks – to halt the daily toll of preventable deaths.

The world's delayed action has already cost countless lives. This cannot go on.

Title: ICJ hears Sudan case accusing UAE of ‘complicity in genocide’

The international court of justice will rule in the next few weeks on whether the United Arab Emirates can be plausibly found “complicit in the commission of genocide” by arming the Rapid Support Forces militia in Sudan’s civil war.

The case was brought by Sudan, whose acting justice minister, Muawia Osman, told the world court in The Hague last week that the country’s “ongoing genocide would not be possible without the complicity of the UAE, including the shipment of arms to the RSF”. Sudan wants ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war.

Responding for the UAE, Reem Ketait, a top foreign ministry official, told the court: “The idea that the UAE is somehow the driver of this reprehensible conflict in Sudan could not be further from the truth. This case is the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE.” Sudan’s allegations were “at best misleading and at worst pure fabrications”, she said.

The case could turn on a “reservation” that the UAE entered when it signed up to the genocide convention in 2005, to the effect that it would not allow a dispute concerning its compliance with the convention to be settled by the ICJ. The UAE says the reservation precludes the ICJ from even forming a preliminary view as to whether the UAE is complicit in acts of genocide.

It would be a severe blow to the UAE, which places great store by its international reputation, if the ICJ did anything but strike the claim from the list. But at a minimum the case’s existence may serve to put further pressure on all the external partners accused of backing the warring factions to think more carefully about the support they provide.

Sudan descended into a deadly conflict in mid-April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between the military and the RSF broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions. Both sides have been accused of abuses in the course of the war.

The UK and other western countries have limited power to stop the fighting. More influence rests with regional powers such as Egypt, which has longstanding ties to the Sudanese army, and the UAE, which has long been accused of arming the RSF – allegations it denies.

On Tuesday a British-led attempt to establish a contact group to facilitate a ceasefire fell apart when Arab states refused to sign a joint communique after a conference in London.

Analysts say UAE’s interest in Sudan stems from overlapping desires to gain political influence there at the expense of Saudi Arabia, exploit its natural resources, and prevent the spread of political Islam, which UAE sees as a threat to its security.

As with many claims for measures to prevent a plausible genocide, the case, which relates specifically to the RSF’s treatment of the Masalit people in Darfur, is being heard at speed. The Sudanese government only filed its application on 5 March.

Prof Eirik Bjorge, a law professor representing Sudan, told the court: “There can be no doubt that the Masalit people is currently being subjected to genocide, and that there is serious evidence that the UAE is failing to prevent this and is complicit.”

Bjorge quoted a panel of UN experts who in January 2024 assessed as “credible” allegations that cargo planes coming from the UAE to an airport in eastern Chad were transporting weapons to the RSF. He also referenced Sudanese intelligence assessments that a field hospital built by the UAE next to the airport in September 2024 was “the primary supply and support hub for the enemy [RSF]” and that Chadian flights transporting military aid were continuing as of March of this year.

Sudan’s lawyers pointed out in court that the Biden administration had announced in January that seven RSF-owned companies in the UAE had been targeted for sanctions, at the same time as the US declared that RSF rebels had committed genocide.

The UAE told the ICJ that none of the seven entities held an active business licence in the UAE, “nor are they currently operating in the UAE”.

Sudan also cited research by Yale Humanitarian Research Lab that identified and located four heavy artillery pieces consistent with a type of Chinese-produced 155mm howitzer artillery gun, which it considered were engaged in the 12-day bombardment of Zamzam camp in December last year. The Yale lab said the UAE was “the only country” known to have bought this type of howitzer.

The UAE’s ambassador to the Netherlands, Ameirah AlHefeiti, told the court the UAE had not provided arms to either of the warring parties. Ketait said the UAE regarded the war as an entirely avoidable factional struggle and accused the Sudanese government of avoiding all UAE-backed efforts at mediation.

Alison Macdonald KC, for the UAE, said the evidence produced of UAE supply of arms was thin, recycled or entirely self-serving. She added that the next UN panel of experts report, due to be published soon, would provide “absolutely no support for the applicant’s claims” – an assertion that is likely to turn on whether the panel of experts was able to establish the content of cargo shipped from the UAE to Chad.

After capturing a convoy containing mortar bombs on November 21, 2024, Sudanese fighters with the Joint Forces filmed videos showing both the weapons and the passports of two Colombian nationals, who seemed to have been part of the weapons convoy. We were able to find one of them, Christian L., on social media and discovered that he documented his journey all the way from Colombia to the Sudanese border. His posts show that he traveled through the United Arab Emirates and then Libya and was probably working as a mercenary.

Recap of the first two articles in our series: On November 21, 2024, Sudanese fighters filmed what they said was a shipment of mortar shells bound for the Rapid Support Forces, the militia that is fighting against the Sudanese Army in the ongoing civil war. These weapons, manufactured in Bulgaria, were shipped to Sudan despite the European Union embargo on sending weapons to this war-torn country. Our team was able to obtain exclusive documents identifying the party at the heart of this transaction: International Golden Group, an Emirati company known for diverting weapons to eastern Libya, to the government led by General Khalifa Haftar, an ally of the United Arab Emirates.

We were able to figure out a lot more about how Bulgarian weapons ended up in Sudan by investigating the two Colombian men, Christian L. and Miguel P., whose passports were seen in the videos filmed by Sudanese fighters from the Joint Forces.

Not a lot of information exists online about Miguel P., though it's a different story when it comes to Christian L., the other Colombian national. Christian would document the minutiae of his life on social media, posting photos of his vacations and gym workouts. Most recently, however, all of Christian’s online profiles have been deleted or changed to private mode, meaning his photos are no longer publicly visible.

From Colombia to Abu Dhabi, via a Paris airport

Christian first indicated he was travelling on October 5, when he posted photos of himself at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. From the documents filmed by the Sudanese militiamen, we know that this fan of weightlifting had served in the Colombian military.

A few days after his stop in Paris, Christian posted videos of himself in the United Arab Emirates . He took pictures on the beach in Abu Dhabi, the same city where International Golden Group , the company that bought the Bulgarian mortar bombs, is based.

On October 5, 2024, Christian L. posted some photos of himself at Roissy-Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris (left). From other posts, it appears that he flew to the French capital from Bogota, Colombia and then on from Paris to the UAE.

On November 17, four days before his identity documents would be in the hands of the Sudanese militia, Christian posted a final video, showing a sunset over a desert landscape. The video seems to have been filmed from a moving vehicle.

This video was not filmed in the desert landscapes of the United Arab Emirates. In the video filmed by Sudanese fighters, you can see that there is a stamp on Christian’s passport that indicates that he left the UAE on October 11, 2024. It appears the young man only stayed a few days in Abu Dhabi.

When a Sudanese fighter leafs through Christian’s passport in one of the videos filmed on November 21, 2024, you can see that there is a stamp indicating that he left the United Arab Emirates on October 11, just a few days after he first posted photos of himself there. This suggest that he only stayed a few days in the UAE before leaving.These dates also indicate that the last video he posted wasn’t filmed in the Emirates. © The FRANCE 24 Observers

Christian’s final video, filmed on the border between Libya and Sudan

British investigative media outlet Bellingcat managed to geolocate the last video Christian posted . It was filmed in Libya , near the town of Al Jawf, the last Libyan town on the road to the Sudanese border, making it likely that Christian filmed this video while on the road towards the border between Libya and Sudan. Three days after this video was posted, his papers would be in the hands of fighters belonging to the Joint Forces. Christian was part of an arms convoy transporting Bulgarian-made weapons to the Rapid Support Forces, according to these fighters.

Ali Trayo, an adviser and negotiator with the Sudan Liberation Movement, a part of the Joint Forces, was able to confirm details with our team:

The Colombian mercenaries are said to have been killed or captured on the border with Libya. They were travelling through the desert. These Colombian mercenaries were experts in weapons. They were there to train the RSF.

Colombian news organisations, like investigative media outlet La Silla Vacia , spoke to former Colombian soldiers who had travelled a similar route to Christian. The media outlet reported that more than 300 of them were recruited and deployed to provide support to the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan, travelling first to the United Arab Emirates and then to Benghazi, in eastern Libya. There they were under the charge of RSF militiamen.

Benghazi and eastern Libya, where these convoys are travelling, are controlled by General Haftar, an ally of the United Arab Emirates. According to sources who spoke to La Silla Vacia , the aim of the operation was to bring a total of 1,800 Colombian mercenaries to Sudan to carry out dangerous combat missions.

“If they find out that someone leaked information, they [the supervisors] have orders to settle it in the sand,” said one of the soldiers, who spoke to the media outlet on condition of anonymity.

Behind the deployment of mercenaries, companies with links to the United Arab Emirates

La Silla Vacia also reported that the former Colombian soldiers were recruited by A4SI, a Colombian company run by a former Colombian soldier who now lives in Dubai and is accused of having links to Colombian cartels.

After being recruited by A4SI, the former soldiers then signed a second contract with the Emirati company Global Security Services Group.

Our team was able to obtain an internal A4SI document – a questionnaire given to potential recruits. The form asks, for example, if the candidates know how to “handle a weapon”, if they have “military experience” and, also, whether – and where – they have any tattoos. Most armed forces either ban tattoos or impose restrictions on their size and location on the body. With the aid of this document, we were also able to determine that A4SI specialises in recruiting soldiers and security agents.

A4SI asks candidates to fill out this “biographical information” document. The questions suggest that the Colombian company specialises in recruiting mercenaries. They ask candidates if they know how to “handle a weapon” as well as if they have "military experience". They also provide a diagram where the recruit can mark the placement of their tattoos, if they have any. Questions about tattoos are common in military recruitment. © A4SI, The France 24 Observers

La Silla Vacia’s investigation shows that Christian’s story – and journey – are not unique. A large number of former Colombian soldiers were recruited and deployed to Libya and then Sudan by two companies – one Colombian, the other Emirati. These mercenaries were then involved in the transfer of Bulgarian mortar shells from Libya to Sudan.

'There is an undeclared alliance between Haftar’s regime in Libya and the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan'

Suliman Baldo is a Sudanese researcher and the founder of the Sudan Policy and Transparency Tracker think tank . He says that this arms convoy was travelling along an established arms smuggling route for the Rapid Support Forces.

General Haftar’s regime was already supporting the Rapid Support Forces before the Sudanese civil war. There is an undeclared alliance between them, because the RSF are thought to have supported Haftar during the Libyan civil war. Since then, in return, General Haftar is sending the RSF ammunition, weapons and petroleum products, which are regularly smuggled into Libya. To complete these transactions, Haftar uses an Islamist militia called the Sobol al-Salam Brigade, based near the town of Kufra.

Kufra is an oasis located near the town of Al-Jawf in southeastern Libya. This is where Christian’s last video was filmed few days before the convoy he was travelling in came under attack.

This map shows the route taken by Colombian mercenaries like Christian. According to the investigation carried out by La Silla Vacia, they landed in Benghazi, the largest town in the parts of Libya under control by General Haftar. Then, they traveled to Sudan by a road between Benghazi and Al-Jawf/Kufra. Christian’s last video was filmed just north of this town. It is then likely that his convoy traveled into the border region between Sudan and Libya (in orange), where his convoy was intercepted by men with the Joint Forces. © France Médias Monde graphic studio

But how were the mortar bombs going to be used in Sudan? By gathering eyewitness accounts and videos filmed by both armed fighters and civilians in these combat zones, the FRANCE 24 Observers team was able to show the devastating impact of this type of munition on the Sudanese population. Our investigation also shows that some Bulgarian-made mortar bombs did indeed reach the Sudanese battlefields , as shown in the video below.

Cairo, Egypt Reuters —

Between 60,000 and 80,000 households - or up to 400,000 people - have been displaced from Sudan’s Zamzam camp in North Darfur after it was taken over by the Rapid Support Forces, according to data from the UN’s International Organization for Migration.

The RSF seized control of the camp on Sunday after a four-day assault that the government and aid groups have said left hundreds dead or wounded.

The United Nations said on Monday that preliminary figures from local sources show more than 300 civilians were killed in fighting on Friday and Saturday around the Zamzam and Abu Shouk displacement camps and the town of al-Fashir in North Darfur.

This includes 10 humanitarian personnel from Relief International, who were killed while operating one of the last functioning health centers in Zamzam camp, said a UN spokesperson.

Rights groups have long warned of possible atrocities should the RSF succeed in its months-long siege of the famine-stricken camp, neighbor to the army’s only remaining stronghold in the Darfur region, al-Fashir.

Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showed burning buildings and smoke in Zamzam on Friday, echoing prior RSF attacks.

The RSF has dismissed such allegations, and says the Zamzam camp was being used as a base for army-aligned groups.

At the start of the war, the camp was home to about half a million people, a number that is thought to have doubled.

In a video shared by the paramilitary force, RSF second in command Abdelrahim Dagalo is seen speaking to a small group of displaced people, promising them food, water, medical care and a return to their homes.

The RSF accelerated its assault on the camp after the army regained control of the capital Khartoum, cementing its retaking of the center of the country.

It has also accelerated drone attacks into army-controlled territory, including an attack on the Atbara power station in the north of the country on Monday according to the national electricity company, cutting off power to the wartime capital of Port Sudan.

The war in Sudan erupted in April 2023, sparked by a power struggle between the army and the RSF, shattering hopes for a transition to civilian rule. The conflict has since displaced millions and devastated wide swathes of the country, spreading famine in several locations.

Renewed attacks on camps – including Zamzam and Abu Shouk – that were sheltering those displaced by earlier violence have now forced an estimated 400,000 to 450,000 people to flee again.

According to the Office of the UN Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, many are moving towards the town of Tawila, the rugged terrain of Jebel Marra or other remote areas – far from health services, clean water and food supplies.

“These population movements are increasingly fluid, unpredictable, and fuelled by ongoing hostilities and fears of a broader offensive on El Fasher,” Humanitarian Coordinator Clementine Nkweta-Salami said in a statement on Sunday.

“The scale and gravity of reported violations, including direct attacks on IDPs and humanitarian personnel, are unacceptable. Civilians must never be a target.”

Worsening crisis

The displacement follows a wave of violence earlier this month, in which Rapid Support Forces (RSF)-affiliated troops reportedly launched coordinated attacks on Zamzam, Abu Shouk and El Fasher, killing hundreds, including children and humanitarian staff.

The situation in Sudan remains one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.

Since conflict erupted between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF in April 2023, more than 12.4 million people have been displaced, including over 3.3 million who have fled to neighbouring countries. Thousands more have been killed in the violence, with the Darfur region among the hardest hit.

Supply lines severed

Ms. Nkweta-Salami warned that the situation is further compounded by rising levels of food insecurity, with displaced populations increasingly cut off from supply chains and assistance.

Risk of epidemic outbreaks, malnutrition and famine are also rising.

Access to El Fasher and surrounding areas remains “dangerously restricted,” she said, reiterating calls for sustained access to the region through established humanitarian infrastructure.

In addition to access, limited funding is further imperilling lifesaving programmes across the region.

“The humanitarian system is currently overstretched,” Ms. Nkweta-Salami said, calling on donors to urgently ramp up flexible and front-loaded support through mechanisms such as the Sudan Humanitarian Fund.

“This funding is critical to support first responders, mobilize life-saving supplies, and sustain emergency response operations,” she added.

Intercommunal clashes in West Darfur

Meanwhile, intercommunal clashes in West Darfur have added to the crisis.

A separate report from the UN International Organization for Migration (IOM) indicated that at least 146 households were displaced from Jebel Moon locality following an attack last week by Arab tribesmen.

“The situation remains tense and unpredictable,” the agency said.

Many of the displaced fled across the border into Chad. Due to security constraints, IOM said verification of numbers remains limited.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized control of a major camp for displaced people in North Darfur, the paramilitary group said on Sunday, after a four-day assault the government and aid groups have said left hundreds dead or wounded.

The fighting has centred around the Zamzam camp, which, along with the nearby Abu Shouk camp, hosts some 700,000 people displaced by Sudan's war. The assault has destroyed shelters, markets, and healthcare facilities, aid groups said.

The RSF said the camp was being used as a base by what it called "mercenary factions". But humanitarian groups denounced the assault as a targeted attack on vulnerable civilians, including women, children and elderly people, who are already facing famine.

The Sudan Liberation Army (SLA), a Darfur militia allied to the national army, has been fighting the RSF around the city of al-Fashir, around 15 km (9.3 miles) from Zamzam, with the help of other local armed groups.

Tens of thousands of camp residents have fled to al-Fashir on foot, overwhelming shelters, and are now sleeping outdoors without food, water, or medicine, SLA spokesperson El-Sadiq Ali El-Nour said on Sunday.

The city - the capital of Sudan's North Darfur province - came under heavy shelling and RSF ground attacks on Sunday, the SLA said, calling for military support from Sudan's armed forces and allied factions.

The Sudanese army has a base with several thousand troops in al-Fashir.

"The leadership of the armed forces must act swiftly to save the lives of approximately 1.5 million people in al-Fashir urgently," the SLA said in a statement. "Darfur must not fight alone."

The RSF has denied targeting civilians and, on Saturday, accused its rivals of orchestrating a media campaign using actors and staged scenes within the camp to falsely incriminate it.

On Sunday, it said it had organised voluntary evacuations for families fleeing al-Fashir and surrounding camps and welcomed humanitarian agencies to respond to the deteriorating conditions.

The war in Sudan erupted in April 2023, sparked by a power struggle between the army and the RSF, shattering hopes for a transition to civilian rule.

The conflict has since displaced millions‮ ‬and devastated regions like Darfur, where the RSF is now fighting to maintain its stronghold amid army advances in Khartoum.

Thousands of displaced Sudanese are continuing to arrive in Tawila after fleeing last weeks paramilitary offensive on Zamzam camp that the UN say killed hundreds, including children and aid workers.

According to Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières/MSF), thousands left the camp following an attack by the Rapid Support Forces and moved to communities already besieged and without lifesaving aid.

Many have made the journey to Tawila camp where the aid agency is operating.

"We are making an urgent appeal to put an end to the siege and the atrocities, to allow those who wish to flee to do so safely, and to deliver humanitarian aid, including by airdropping food and medicines to El Fasher if necessary,” the group said in a statement on Friday.

MSF suspended its activities in Zamzam in February due to the escalating violence and blockade, it said.

The NGO said that about 1,600 patients have required emergency services in Tawila, mainly because of severe dehydration.

The U.N. migration agency said the RSF attacks in Zamzam camp have displaced between 60-thousand to 80-thousand families in the first two days following the assault.

The majority of the families remain within El Fasher, the neighbouring capital city of North Darfur, which is under military control but has been besieged by the RSF for over a year.

Sudan plunged into conflict on April 15, 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including the vast western Darfur region.

Since then, at least 24 thousand people have been tallied as being killed, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is far higher.

The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, known as the RSF, carried out the recent attacks after the Sudanese military late last month regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war.

The commander of the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group fighting the Sudanese government armed forces for two years, has declared that he would establish an alternative government, two years after war broke out in Sudan in April 2023.

“On this anniversary, we proudly declare the establishment of the Government of Peace and Unity,” Dagalo said in a recorded speech, adding that other groups have joined the RSF-led administration, including a faction of the Sudan’s Liberation Movement, which controls parts of Kordofan region.

The RSF government will rule over parts of the country, including the western Darfur region where the United Nations says recent attacks by the group have killed over 400 people.

Sudan was plunged into chaos on April 15, 2023 when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare across the country.

Since then, at least 24,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher. The war has driven about 13 million people from their homes, including 4 million who have crossed into neighboring countries, and pushed parts of the country into famine.

The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, according to the U.N. and international rights groups.

Dagalo’s announcement has come a few days after his forces and allied militias rampaged through two famine-hit camps, which shelter some 700,000 Sudanese who fled their homes, in North Darfur province.

The multi-day attack on the Zamzam and Abu Shouk camps killed more than 400 people, including 12 aid workers and dozens of children, the U.N. humanitarian office said, citing local sources.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday the attack forced up to 400,000 people to flee the Zamzam camp in recent days.

He said the camp has become inaccessible after the RSF and its allied militias took control of it, “restricting the movement of those remaining, especially young people.”

CAIRO (AP) — Inside Sudan’s biggest museum, the exhibition halls once filled with statues and relics from centuries of ancient civilizations are trashed, littered with debris. The display cases stand empty and shattered. A mummy lies exposed in an open storage box. All the gold artifacts have been looted.

The Sudan National Museum has been wrecked by two years of war in Sudan, with most of its artifacts stolen. Authorities blame the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which held this district of Khartoum along the banks of the Nile River for most of the conflict.

Since the Sudanese military regained control of the capital last month, officials have been working to assess the damage and loss in hopes of one day restoring the museum.

“The losses are extremely big and saddening. A significant number of antiquities were stolen,” Gamal ElDeen Zain al-Abdeen, a senior official at the National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums, told The Associated Press. “The RSF destroyed everything ... concerning the civilization of the Sudanese people.”

The National Museum had thousands of pieces, dating back to the Paleolithic era well before the development of agriculture, and through the kingdoms of ancient Sudan. Many came from the Napatan era in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C., when pharaohs from Sudan ruled over much of ancient Egypt, or from the later Meroitic kingdom that built pyramids in Sudan. Other halls had later Christian and Islamic material.

Some pieces too heavy to carry remain in place. In the museum’s garden, a line of stone lions remains, as do the Colossi of Tabo, two large pharaonic-style statues. Also remaining are three pharaonic temples that were moved from northern Sudan and reassembled at the museum in the 1960s to escape the rising waters of Lake Nasser from Egypt’s construction of the High Dam.

But many objects are gone. Looters broke into the locked storerooms and made off with all the gold artifacts, Zain al-Abdeen said. But it was too early to know how much of the museum’s collection had been stolen, he said.

Museums paid a heavy price in the war

He blamed the RSF for the destruction, saying they had fighters in the museum at some point during the war.

The war in Sudan broke out in April 2023, after tensions between the Sudanese army and the rival RSF turned into battles in the streets of Khartoum and rapidly spread around the country. The RSF held much of Khartoum during the war, including the district of the museum.

Now that they have been driven out, the extent of the destruction from fighting and looting is coming clear.

“Khartoum in general has been destroyed, particularly the center of Khartoum,” Zain al-Abdeen said. “No building was spared from the bloodshed and theft, and this is what I saw with my own eyes.” He said all the city’s museums were damaged, particularly the Ethnography Museum, where walls were demolished and halls and offices burned.

The ransacking is a blow to a country with a rich heritage, one that has deep resonance among Sudanese but is often overlooked abroad because of Sudan’s decades of instability.

‘Erasing history’

UNESCO said in September it was concerned about looting at the Sudan National Museum, which it helped renovate in 2019. It warned that sale or removal of artifacts “would result in the disappearance of part of the Sudanese cultural identity and jeopardize the country’s recovery.”

A UNESCO spokesperson said Friday that damage, looting and destruction of museums and cultural sites happened across Sudan’s states of Khartoum, River Nile, Northern State, Gezeira and the Darfur region. An accurate assessment isn’t possible due to the ongoing fighting.

The Sudan National Museum is among several that have undergone “extensive looting and substantial damage,” according to UNESCO.

Sedeeq Mohamed Sedeeq, who lives near the museum, said the RSF vowed democracy and liberation but instead they are “erasing the oldest nation in history, erasing its history.”

Reconstruction plans for destroyed museums will begin after committees assess the damage and recommend proposals for rehabilitation, Zein al-Abdeen said. The plans are expected to include building repairs, restoration of the antiquities storage areas and fixing the museum’s surrounding grounds.

At least 20,000 people have been killed since the war broke out, though the number is likely far higher. The war has also driven more than 14 million people from their homes and pushed parts of the country into famine.

Dozens of displaced Sudanese arrived Saturday in Tawila town in North Darfur after attacks by Sudan's notorious paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces.

The Rapid Support Forces and allied militias launched an offensive on the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk camps and the nearby city of el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur province, on Friday, a UN official said.

The two-day attack on the famine-hit camps for displaced people left more than 100 dead, including 20 children and nine aid workers.

El-Fasher is under the control of the military, which has fought the RSF since Sudan descended into civil war two years ago, killing more than 24,000 people, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is likely far higher.

The camps were attacked again on Saturday, the UN official said in a statement.

The offensive forced about 2,400 people to flee the camps and el-Fasher, according to the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees, a local group in Darfur.

Zamzam and Abu Shouk shelter more than 700,000 people who have been forced to flee their homes across Darfur during past bouts of fighting in the region, the UN said.

Late last month, the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war.

But the RSF still controls most of Darfur and some other areas.

The two camps are among five areas in Sudan where famine was detected by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, IPC, a global hunger monitoring group. The war has created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with about 25 million people — half of Sudan’s population — facing extreme hunger.

Sudanese paramilitaries killed the entire staff of the last medical clinic in a famine-stricken camp in the western region of Darfur, Sudan, as part of a broader assault that killed at least 100 people, aid groups and the United Nations said on Saturday.

The assault on the Zamzam camp, which holds 500,000 people in the besieged city of El Fasher, was notable even by the standards of a civil war that has seen countless atrocities as well as accusations of genocide.

Paramilitaries with the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F., broke through the camp perimeter on Friday evening after hours of shelling. They then destroyed hundreds of homes and the camp’s main market before turning their attack on the camp’s last remaining medical clinic, according to Relief International, the aid group that runs the facility.

Nine hospital employees were killed, including the head doctor, the aid group said in a statement on Saturday. “We have learned the unthinkable,” the statement said. “This is a profound tragedy for our organization.”

Gang rapes of dozens of women and girls as young as 15 were recorded between April 2023 and October 2024, according to the latest Sudan war report from Amnesty International.

Gang rapes of 36 women and girls as young as 15 recorded between April 2023 and October 2024

* Woman torn away from breast feeding baby and attacked and 11-year-old boy beaten to death as he tried to help his mother

* RSF soldiers tied a woman to a tree before one raped her as the others watched - 'It was the most horrific day in my life'

* For survivors, cuts to vital USAID-funded programmes have diminished prospects for accessing comprehensive sexual health care

* 'The RSF's attacks on civilians are shameful and cowardly, and any countries supporting the RSF, including by supplying them with weapons, shares in their shame' - Deprose Muchena

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has inflicted widespread sexual violence on women and girls throughout Sudan's two-year civil war to humiliate, assert control, and displace communities across the country. The RSF's atrocities, including rape, gang-rape and sexual slavery, amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, Amnesty International said in a new 34-page report.

The report, "They raped all of us: Sexual violence against women and girls in Sudan", documents RSF soldiers raping or gang-raping 36 women and girls as young as 15, plus other forms of sexual violence, in four Sudanese states between April 2023 and October 2024. Violations include raping a mother after tearing away her breastfeeding baby and the 30-day sexual enslavement of a woman in Khartoum, as well as severe beatings, torture with hot liquid or sharp blades, and murder.

Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International's Senior Director for Regional Human Rights Impact, said:

"The RSF's assaults on Sudanese women and girls are sickening, depraved and aimed at inflicting maximum humiliation. They have targeted civilians, particularly women and girls, with unimaginable cruelty during this war.

"The world must act to stop the RSF's atrocities by stemming the flow of weapons into Sudan, pressuring the leadership to end sexual violence, and holding perpetrators including top commanders to account.

"The horror of the RSF's sexual violence is overwhelming, but the cases documented among refugees represent a small fraction of the violations likely committed. The RSF's attacks on civilians are shameful and cowardly, and any countries supporting them, including by supplying them with weapons, shares in their shame.

"The international response to the suffering of Sudanese women and girls has been reprehensible. The world has failed to protect civilians, provide sufficient humanitarian aid or hold perpetrators accountable for these crimes. It's time for people and governments around the world to establish the truth of what has happened in Sudan, bring suspected perpetrators to justice and provide reparations and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health care to survivors."

Eruption of violence and war crimes since April 2023

Sudan's civil war erupted in April 2023 between the RSF and Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), killing tens of thousands of people and displacing more than 11 million to date. Both sides have committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, some of which amount to war crimes, including sexual violence against women and girls.

For the report, Amnesty interviewed 30 people, mostly survivors and relatives of survivors in Ugandan refugee camps. All survivors and witnesses identified RSF fighters as perpetrators. The RSF's use of sexual violence throughout the conflict and across Sudan, combined with the fact that many attacks took place in the presence of other soldiers, victims and other civilians, indicates perpetrators did not feel compelled to hide their crimes and did not fear any response.

The RSF did not respond to Amnesty's requests for comment.

'The most horrific day in my life'

Every survivor of sexual violence who was interviewed described how the attack caused massive physical or mental harm and had devastating impacts on their families. All fled their homes after.

In Nyala, South Darfur, RSF soldiers tied a woman to a tree before one raped her as the others watched. "It was the most horrific day in my life," she said.

In Madani, Gezira, three RSF soldiers' gang-raped a woman in front of her 12-year-old daughter and sister-in-law. "It was so humiliating," the woman said. "I feel broken."

Numerous survivors said RSF soldiers raped them on suspicion of SAF affiliation. Female medical workers said RSF troops raped them if they could not save wounded soldiers. In one such case, a nurse said 13 soldiers abducted her in Khartoum North and forced her to treat severely injured men before gang-raping her, leaving her unconscious.

Amnesty found two cases of sexual slavery in Khartoum, including a woman who said RSF troops held her captive in a house for a month, raping her almost every day.

Survivors said anyone who resisted rape risked beatings, torture and other ill-treatment, or murder, including an 11-year-old boy who an RSF soldier beat to death as he tried to help his mother.

A 'reprehensible' response

The world's response has likewise been shameful as victims and survivors lack both health care and justice.

No survivors accessed timely post-rape care or reported attacks to Sudanese authorities due to ongoing fighting or fear of stigma and reprisals. Some suffer kidney pains, irregular periods, walking difficulties or long-term psychological trauma. Children who saw relatives raped suffer nightmares.

As refugees, all survivors said their priority was to get medical treatment for injuries and diseases inflicted by the RSF or for health conditions developed in their captivity. However, cuts to vital USAID-funded programmes have diminished prospects for accessing comprehensive sexual health care.

Survivors also demanded justice and accountability. One woman raped in Omdurman said: "Women are not leading or participating in this war, but it is women who are suffering the most. I want the whole world to know about the suffering of Sudanese women and girls and ensure that all the bad men who raped us are punished."

UK Government to host conference on 15 April

The UK Government is due to host a ministerial-level international Sudan Conference in London on 15 April aimed at strengthening the international community's response to the conflict.

Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International UK's, Chief Executive, said:

"Bringing together international leaders could not come at a more vital time for the UK to champion the protection of women and girls from conflict in Sudan. However, the UK's own drastic aid cut plans are deeply worrying and set a poor example - especially when the world is seemingly turning its back on those experiencing extreme violence. Despite the Prime Minister stressing that the UK will still hold a key humanitarian role in Sudan, its aid cut plans may well discourage additional funding from other states. This conference must recognise the horrendous findings from Amnesty's report and remain prioritising funds for those most at risk."

Multiple attacks by Sudan's Rapid Support Forces killed and wounded over 100 people, including 20 children and nine aid workers, according to the UN. The RSF has denied responsibility for attacks on civilians.

An assault by Sudan's paramilitary force on the Zamzam and Abu Shorouk Camps for displaced people in Darfur is feared to have left over 100 people, including 20 children, dead or wounded.

United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami said Saturday that the offensive by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan's rebel paramilitary, took place over at least two days, destroying homes, markets and healthcare facilities.

Over 700,000 displaced people, many of whom are now trapped without safe refuge, live in the two camps.

What else do we know about the attack?

In a statement, Nkweta-Salami added that nine aid workers were killed "while operating one of the very few remaining health posts still operational" in Zamzam camp.

"This represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers in Sudan since the onset of this conflict nearly two years ago," she added.

Relief International, the last organization providing critical services at Zamzam Camp, reported the aid workers who died were their colleagues, including doctors and drivers, adding that its clinic was overtaken.

"This was a targeted attack on the most vulnerable, elderly people, women, and children," it said in a statement.

The group said the central market in Zamzam along with hundreds of makeshift homes in the camp were destroyed.

According to the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees, a local group in Dafur, the attacks forced around 2,400 people to flee the camps and the nearby city of el-Fasher, the only city in Darfur not controlled by the RSF.

What did the RSF say?

The paramilitary group denied allegations of atrocities in the Zamzam Camp, dismissing them as fabricated. It claimed a recently circulated video purportedly showing civilian suffering in the camp was staged by the Sudanese army.

The RSF accused the army of orchestrating a media campaign using actors and staged scenes to falsely incriminate them, denying responsibility for any attacks on civilians.

The paramilitary group has been locked in a vicious fight for power with the Sudanese military since April 2023, creating what is believed to be the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

Both parties have been accused of committing war crimes and violating international humanitarian law, with tens of thousands dying in the war and more than 12 million displaced.

Around 25 million people, nearly half the country's population, are believed to be facing extreme hunger.

Recent weeks have seen Sudan's military make gains in the capital Khartoum, prompting the RSF to increase its offensive in regions in Darfur still not under its control. The fighting has been mostly concentrated in these two provinces.

Title: Sudan: Two Years On, Sudan's War Is Spreading

After the Sudanese army recaptured Khartoum, many hoped that Sudan's war would start winding down. Instead, as it enters its third year, the conflict is escalating and likely to expand in scope, unless diplomats make a concerted push for peace talks.

Two years into Sudan's civil war, the country and the surrounding region face a moment of reckoning. The biggest turning point in the conflict to date came in March, when the Sudanese army recaptured Khartoum from its adversary, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The RSF had held the upper hand in the capital since the war's onset, forcing the army to decamp to Port Sudan in the far east and pushing the state to the brink of collapse. But instead of using this advance to pursue peace, the army appears to want to press on for total victory, while the RSF aims to expand the war to new areas. Both sides are still receiving ample outside support to continue fighting. Further escalation could lead the country to fragment. It also risks destabilising Sudan's neighbours, especially Chad and South Sudan. Those with the most leverage over the army, namely Saudi Arabia and Egypt, should persuade it to give peace negotiations a try. Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates - the RSF's main outside patron - should pursue a détente with the army that de-escalates the war and gives such talks a chance to succeed.

The Army Gets the Upper Hand

Sudan's war broke out after Omar al-Bashir was overthrown following three decades of dictatorial rule. To coup-proof his regime, Bashir had cultivated the RSF, promoting a militia recruited from among the Arabs of Sudan's western region of Darfur to a paramilitary force rivalling the military establishment. When popular protests brought the Bashir regime to its knees in early 2019, the army and the RSF seized joint control of the state, forming a junta. After agreeing to cede power to a civilian government, they reneged, retaking the reins in 2021 before turning on each other two years later amid mounting pressure to restore civilian rule. Fighting began in Khartoum on 15 April 2023, turning the capital into a battlefield.

The RSF seemed to have the advantage for most of the war. It besieged pockets of army control in the Khartoum area. It then conquered most of Darfur, with the major exception of North Darfur, as well as much of the Kordofan region in Sudan's south. In late 2023, the RSF launched a surprise offensive south east of Khartoum, taking more of the riverine heartland. But RSF gains peaked in mid-2024, with the army embarking on a multi-front counter-offensive in September.

In early 2025, the Sudanese army and its allies began making strides in greater Khartoum, culminating in a series of devastating defeats for the RSF. At the end of March, in a major victory, the army recaptured the presidential palace, the symbolic locus of national sovereignty. Beleaguered RSF fighters fled west across the Jebel Aulia bridge, the last Nile River crossing they still held, despite a plea from their leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti, to make a stand in the capital. Some of the fighters retreated to RSF positions in Omdurman, Khartoum's sister city west of the Nile, but others went farther west back to Kordofan and Darfur.

What Lies Ahead

The army's triumph in Khartoum opens a new chapter in the war. The heart of the Sudanese state and the country's only megalopolis, the capital was the prize in the conflict. By recapturing the city, the army and its supporters believe they have saved the state from ruin. For many Sudanese in the riverine centre, regaining Khartoum is akin to winning the war, given that they are accustomed to long-running insurgencies in Sudan's western and southern peripheries. The RSF, in addition to suffering a series of military defeats, has lost its most significant point of leverage in any peace talks, which would have been to satisfy the army's longstanding demand that it pull out of Khartoum's residential areas. If this war merely concerned the Sudanese, its course would be easier to predict. The army would likely continue to press west, pushing the RSF back toward its base in Darfur, while arming aligned forces in Darfur and Kordofan to tie down the RSF in local conflict. In other words, the war could be expected to slowly fizzle, with low-level insurgency in parts of Sudan's west and south.

The heavy outside involvement in the war, however, makes escalation more likely.

The heavy outside involvement in the war, however, makes escalation more likely. Both sides continue to receive substantial outside supplies, including new drones and counter-drone technologies. Furthermore, Arab and African capitals are competing to project power via Sudan, which sits on the strategic Red Sea, and they view the war's outcome as representing high stakes. A coalition of primarily Arab powers, led by Egypt, offers the most support to the army, while the UAE is the RSF's main backer.

There are substantial risks to escalation. More war endangers Sudan's cohesion as a state, in addition to the destruction and hardship it will cause. The world's largest humanitarian crisis, with half the country's pre-war population facing acute food insecurity, will surely worsen. The RSF's next move appears to be to try broadening its wartime coalition, especially by adding the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-North), a long-time rebel group based along the Sudan-South Sudan border that has historical links to South Sudan's ruling party. This partnership was cemented at a surprise conference in Nairobi in February, leading the RSF and SPLM-North to launch new joint offensives in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states along the South Sudanese and Ethiopian borders. The RSF also appears determined to take the war to Sudan's north, which has mostly been spared to date and is a major power base of the army. In early April, the RSF said its forces had launched a new offensive aimed at the north. This move could deepen the inter-communal tensions that are already tearing at Sudan's social fabric.

In early April, the RSF said its forces had launched a new offensive aimed at the north. This move could deepen the inter-communal tensions that are already tearing at Sudan's social fabric.

On the other side, to retake territory, the Sudanese army has been forced to arm a variety of militias to fight the RSF. The empowerment of these militias poses a threat to Sudan's stability; they could render the country's east increasingly ungovernable if they continue to proliferate under the army's patronage.

Secondly, the escalation is deepening regional polarisation, threatening the stability of neighbouring Chad and South Sudan above all. Tensions between the Sudanese army and both N'Djamena and Juba have been rising in recent weeks. Chad's alleged willingness to serve as a major conduit for arms to the RSF risks renewed proxy war with the Sudanese army. (A cross-border conflict involving proxies destabilised both Sudan and Chad two decades ago, before a 2010 rapprochement.) South Sudan, meanwhile, looks to be heading toward a renewed civil war of its own, which will likely overlap with Sudan's along parts of the border, which also have a long history of proxy warfare. The risk of merger with other conflicts, such as the one that may be brewing between Ethiopia and Eritrea, is also real.

The prospects for peace talks are poor absent concerted regional action to wind down Sudan's war before it widens.

The prospects for peace talks are poor absent concerted regional action to wind down Sudan's war before it widens. Publicly, army head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan rejects peace talks, saying the war will continue until the RSF disarms and surrenders. Any push for dialogue will likely face resistance from within Burhan's wartime coalition, including from hardline generals, the Islamist movement tied to the former Bashir regime and groups that rebelled against Bashir in Darfur (prompting him to rally the militias that later became the RSF). Meanwhile, the RSF is licking its wounds and appears in no mood to negotiate, either, hoping that outside backing, lightning strikes on new areas in Sudan and its alliance with the SPLM-North may turn the tide back in its favour.

Even worse, there are signs that Sudan's war may become too fragmented for any straightforward resolution. Negotiations could be further complicated should Burhan and the RSF form competing governments, as both have promised to do. Henceforth, some RSF officials say, they will negotiate only through the new alliance with the SPLM-North and others. Talks between the wartime coalitions - Burhan's, on one hand, and the RSF's forged in Nairobi, on the other - could grow so unwieldy that they would stall, leaving the country confronting de facto partition. Such a division would risk destabilising Sudan's neighbourhood for years to come.

Toward De-escalation

Rather than let the region unravel, diplomats should work for de-escalation, with representatives of states that back the belligerents leading the way. First, the countries with the most leverage over Burhan, namely Saudi Arabia and Egypt, should press the general to use the army's victory in Khartoum to pivot toward peace. Saudi Arabia, in particular, could offer funds for reconstruction of Khartoum and other devastated areas, conditional on a negotiated ceasefire. Possible venues for such talks include Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (where two rounds of talks occurred in 2023), and Manama, Bahrain, where Egypt and the UAE organised quiet discussions including Saudi Arabia and the United States in early 2024.

Secondly, the UAE and the Sudanese army should seek a détente that can de-escalate the war and create an opening for peace. Though there have been numerous back channels between the army and Abu Dhabi, none has panned out, with both sides alleging bad faith. Some sort of rapprochement may be a precondition of a final peace deal, given the UAE's influence over the RSF and the army's objections to Emirati participation in previous mediation efforts.

Further avenues of regional de-escalation would also help. Egypt and the RSF should consider dialogue, to reduce ill-will and assure Cairo that a peace deal would not pave the way for a vengeful RSF to counter its interests. (Riyadh and the RSF have relations predating Sudan's civil war, with thousands of RSF fighters deployed by Saudi Arabia along its southern border with Yemen.) Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE should also agree on parameters for bringing the war to an end, including establishment of a single national government that could reunite the country and would be acceptable to all three states. In addition, both N'Djamena and Juba should try to strike a better balance in their relations with the warring parties in Sudan to prevent spiralling frictions with the army.

Thirdly, Egypt and the African Union should coordinate more closely as they press forward with their respective dialogue tracks among Sudan's civilian political groups. Mediators need to be able to propose the creation of a unity civilian government that is acceptable to a broad swathe of Sudanese and present it as a realistic outcome following a negotiated ceasefire. These talks with civilian groups are key to preserving the hope that a united Sudan can emerge after the war.

The West still has a role to play. Though the Trump administration has yet to show interest in Sudan, there are plenty of reasons for it to do so.

Finally, the West still has a role to play. Though the Trump administration has yet to show interest in Sudan, there are plenty of reasons for it to do so. Washington's close ties with Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Cairo (in addition to other involved capitals, including Ankara, Doha, Addis Ababa and Nairobi) mean that the U.S. remains indispensable to a negotiated peace in Sudan (at least in the view of some). President Donald Trump has declared an ambition to be a peacemaker, and the war in Sudan - now the world's bloodiest - offers an opportunity to use U.S. leverage to silence the guns.

European diplomacy is also important. The UK should stimulate discussion of means of ending the war, including with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and the U.S., at its conference on the war's second anniversary. To be held in London on 15 April, this event is designed as a follow-up to the humanitarian aid pledging conference for Sudan that took place in Paris on the same date in 2024. The UK should closely coordinate its Sudan efforts with others in Europe, including the European Union, Norway and Switzerland, especially given the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's stance.

If the war keeps escalating, the result will likely be fragmentation in Sudan and destabilisation of the neighbourhood, as fighting spills across the border into South Sudan and maybe other countries as well. Outside powers can proceed on their present course, egging on the army and RSF, which will push Sudan toward the edge of utter destruction. Alternatively, they can stop fuelling the conflict and start working in concert to bring it to a speedy close. The consequences of their choice will not be confined to Sudan.

At least 89 have been killed in a cluster of villages in the Sudanese city of Omdurman by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) a Sudanese human rights organization has said.

Many more were injured in the attack that saw the paramilitary group carrying out random artillery shelling and direct gunfire.

The Emergency Lawyer’s Association has accused the RSF of violating "human rights and international law," the statement added that its forces engaged in widespread looting of homes and shops, arrested several young men from the villages "and forced them at gunpoint to transport the looted goods."

Many have fled to the Jabal Awlia area, in hopes of finding safety.

Sudan is already in the grips of the largest displacement crisis, to date, an estimated 8.8 million people have been forced from their homes to camps and other locations within Sudan; 3.5 million more have fled across borders, according to the UN.

On the battlefield, the RSF continues to suffer setbacks.

Since the beginning of the year - the army has seized Sennar, Al Jazeera and White Nile state, as well as the capital Khartoum.

The captures have given the military control of the center of Sudan, regaining Darfur appears to be the army’s next target.

Grave violations against children have surged across Sudan’s Darfur states since the start of the year, with 110 violations verified in North Darfur alone and a staggering 83 per cent increase in child casualties in Sudan compared to the first quarter of 2024.

In Al Fasher, North Darfur, more than 70 children have been killed or maimed in less than three months.

Since early 2025, intense shelling and airstrikes in the Zamzam camp for internally displaced people (IDPs), have resulted in 16 per cent of all verified child casualties in Al Fasher.

“An estimated 825,000 children are trapped in a growing catastrophe in and around Al Fasher,” said UNICEF Representative for Sudan, Sheldon Yett. “With these numbers reflecting only verified incidents, it is likely the true toll is far higher, with children in a daily struggle to survive.

Death is a constant threat for children, whether due to the fighting around them or the collapse of the vital services they rely on to survive.”

More than 60,000 people have been newly displaced in North Darfur in just 6 weeks, adding to the more than 600,000 people displaced between April 2024, when the violence escalated, and January 2025 – including 300,000 children.

An estimated 900,000 people remain in Al Fasher and 750,000 in Zamzam camp trapped by active conflict. Half of them are children.

All access routes are blocked. The Tawila-Zamzam road, once a vital link, is now impassable given the complete collapse in security.

Armed groups are targeting rural villages and insecurity has made delivery of aid and commercial goods nearly impossible.

Communities face alarming shortages of water, food, medicine, and nutrition supplies. Food prices have nearly doubled in three months.

Malnutrition is rife. North Darfur has more than 457,000 acutely malnourished children, including nearly 146,000 suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) – the deadliest form.

Six localities within the state are at risk of famine, all among the worst-affected by violence and access constraints.

UNICEF delivered ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), and other lifesaving supplies to Al Fasher three months ago, but these stocks are now depleted. Repeated efforts by UNICEF and partners to deliver more supplies have been unsuccessful given threats from armed fighters and criminal gangs. In Zamzam, 2,300 children with severe acute malnutrition are currently being treated but RUTF stocks will be depleted within the next three weeks.

UNICEF estimates 500,000 children are at immediate risk if supplies cannot be delivered.

The Sudanese army has claimed to have complete control over the capital city of Khartoum. The two-year civil war, however, continues as the RSF militia still controls large swaths of the country.

The Sudanese army announced it had fully seized control of the capital, Khartoum, a week after recapturing the presidential palace from rival paramilitaries.

Army spokesperson Nabil Abdullah said late Thursday that forces had eliminated the last pockets of the Rapid Support Forces in the capital.

"Our forces today have successfully and forcibly cleansed the last pockets of the remnants of the Daglo terrorist militia in Khartoum locality," Abdullah said in a statement.

Sudan's army chief, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, declared the capital "free" from the RSF on Wednesday. He made this announcement from inside the recaptured presidential palace.

US aiming to step up diplomatic efforts to end war

However, the recapture of the capital does not signal an immediate end to the two-year-long civil war. Though government forces have made advances in Khartoum and central Sudan, RSF fighters still control large swaths of land across the country, notably in the western Darfur region.

Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday that Washington aims to step up diplomatic efforts to end the war in Sudan after the recent surge in violence, including in Khartoum.

"We are trying to figure out and engage with our partners, soliciting their ideas about what to do," he said.

Fighting has killed thousands, displaced millions

The UN has called the situation in Sudan the "world's worst humanitarian crisis" with fighting, widespread famine and disease forcing some 12.5 million of Sudan's 46 million citizens to flee.

Death tolls, both because of fighting and the humanitarian crisis, are estimated to be between 60,000 and 150,000.

How did Sudan's civil war start?

Sudan's civil war erupted two years ago as the country sought to transition to democracy.

The government troops and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were allies that joined forces to oust Islamist leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019.

The Sudanese Armed Forces under General Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan and the Rapid Support Forces, which are headed by General Mohammed Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, initially joined a civilian-led transitional council following the fall of al-Bashir.

But in October 2021, they staged a coup together, derailing Sudan's democratic transition to a civilian government, and Hemeti became Burhan's deputy.

The two generals turned on each other after Hemeti refused to integrate his militia into the national army triggering the civil war.

El Gezira — A Sudanese rights group has warned today that mass trials of alleged paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) collaborators risk turning the judiciary into a tool for political reprisals. Hundreds are already facing trial in El Gezira, with thousands more expected to follow.

The El Gezira Observatory for Human Rights said authorities must ensure transparency and fair trial standards. It raised concerns that many defendants had little time to prepare their defence and questioned whether the prosecutions were politically motivated.

A criminal court in El Gezira has started hearings against 950 individuals accused of working with the RSF.

Reports indicate that Sudan's Public Prosecution that more than 15,000 charges have been filed against alleged collaborators, intelligence operatives, and RSF leaders. The charges include crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide in West Darfur.

The trials follow the Sudanese Armed Forces recapture of El Gezira, as authorities move to prosecute those accused of aiding the RSF.

Rights groups fear the sheer number of cases and the speed of the prosecutions indicate a political purge rather than due process.

Sudanese military forces pushed toward the presidential palace in the battle-scarred capital, Khartoum, on Thursday, signaling a potential turning point in Sudan’s devastating civil war, now approaching its third year.

Video footage showed Sudanese troops about 500 yards east of the palace compound, which overlooks the river Nile, and is controlled by the Rapid Support Forces, or R.S.F., the army’s powerful paramilitary rival.

Capturing the palace would be a major symbolic victory for Sudan’s army, which lost most of Khartoum to the R.S.F. in the early days of the war in April 2023. It would also significantly boost the military’s six-month-old drive to push the paramilitaries out of the city entirely.

Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happening

13 June 2024 Share Save Beverly Ochieng & Wedaeli Chibelushi BBC Monitoring & BBC News Share Save

Getty Images The war in Sudan has caused one of the "world's largest displacement crises", the UN has said

In April last year, Sudan was thrown into disarray when its army and a powerful paramilitary group began a vicious struggle for power.

The war, which continues to this day, has claimed more than 15,000 lives. And in what the United Nations has called one of the world's "largest displacement crises", about nine million people have been forced to flee their homes.

There have been warnings of genocide regarding the western region of Darfur, where residents say they have been targeted by fighters based on their ethnicity.

Here is what you need to know.

Where is Sudan?

Sudan is in north-east Africa and is one of the largest countries on the continent, covering 1.9 million sq km (734,000 sq miles).

The population of Sudan is predominantly Muslim and the country's official languages are Arabic and English.

Even before the war started, Sudan was one the poorest countries in the world. Its 46 million people were in 2022 living on an average annual income of $750 (£600) a head.

The conflict has made things much worse. Last year, the economy shrunk by 40%, Sudan's finance minister said.

Who is fighting who in Sudan?

After the 2021 coup, a council of generals ran Sudan, led by the two military men at the centre of this dispute:

Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the armed forces and in effect the country's president

And his deputy and leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as "Hemedti".

They disagreed on the direction the country was going in and the proposed move towards civilian rule.

The main sticking points were plans to include the 100,000-strong RSF into the army, and who would then lead the new force.

The suspicions were that both generals wanted to hang on to their positions of power, unwilling to lose wealth and influence.

What are the Rapid Support Forces?

The RSF was formed in 2013 and has its origins in the notorious Janjaweed militia that brutally fought rebels in Darfur, where they were accused of ethnic cleansing against the region's non-Arabic population.

Since then, Gen Dagalo has built a powerful force that has intervened in conflicts in Yemen and Libya. He has also developed economic interests including controlling some of Sudan's gold mines.

Before the current conflict erupted, the RSF had been accused of human rights abuses, including the massacre of more than 120 protesters in June 2019.

Such a strong force outside the army has been seen as a source of instability in the country.

Why did the fighting start?

Shooting between the two sides began on 15 April 2023 following days of tension as members of the RSF were redeployed around the country in a move that the army saw as a threat.

There had been some hope that talks could resolve the situation but these never happened.

It is disputed who fired the first shot but the fighting swiftly escalated in different parts of the country.

Why is the military in charge of Sudan?

This fighting is the latest episode in bouts of tension that followed the 2019 ousting of long-serving President Omar al-Bashir, who came to power in a coup in 1989.

There were huge street protests calling for an end to his near-three decade rule and the army mounted a coup to get rid of him.

But civilians continued to campaign for the introduction of democracy.

A joint military-civilian government was then established but that was overthrown in another coup in October 2021, when Gen Burhan took over.

And since then the rivalry between Gen Burhan and Gen Dagalo has intensified.

A framework deal to put power back in the hands of civilians was agreed in December 2022 but talks to finalise the details failed.

Who controls which parts of the country?

When it began, the conflict appeared to be around the control of key installations.

However, much of it is now happening in urban areas and civilians have become unwitting victims.

The RSF captured much of the capital, Khartoum, and Darfur.

The military controls most of the north and the east, including the key Red Sea port of Port Sudan.

In a major blow to the army, the RSF seized the strategic city of Wad Madani in December, along with much of the surrounding Gezira state. Hundreds and thousands of civilians were forced to flee the city, which had become a hub for humanitarian services and a refuge for those who had escaped conflict in other parts of the country.

In February, the army recaptured the centre of Omdurman, one of three cities along the River Nile that form Sudan's wider capital, Khartoum. It regained control of the state broadcaster there - a symbolic breakthrough for the army.

Attention is now on el-Fasher, the last major urban centre in Darfur that is still held by the army. The RSF has laid siege to the city, causing hundreds of casualties, overwhelming hospitals and blocking food supplies.

How have civilians been impacted by the war?

As well as sparking major displacement, both sides in the conflict have been accused of war crimes.

When leaving his post in September, UN envoy to Sudan Volker Perthes accused the RSF of committing sexual violence, looting and killings in areas it controls. He also condemned the Sudanese armed forces for indiscriminate aerial bombings.

During the early days of the war, the BBC found that both sides had launched airstrikes and artillery fire at hospitals while patients were still in the building and doctors have also been singled out for attack. Both acts are potential war crimes.

The UN says the war has triggered the "world's worst hunger crisis". According to non-profit organisation Action Against Hunger, five million Sudanese people are dealing with "emergency levels of hunger".

Aid agencies have long complained that security threats and roadblocks have greatly hampered their effort to deliver vital goods, like food, to the people who need them.

Where have allegations of genocide come from?

In October, the BBC saw fresh evidence of ethnic cleansing in Darfur, most of which has been blamed on militias that are part of - or affiliated with - the RSF.

This year a report from campaign group Human Rights Watch said ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity had been committed against ethnic Massalit and non-Arab communities in the region by the paramilitary forces and its Arab allies.

The UK, UN, US and a number of other entities have said civilians in the state are being targeted because of their identity.

UN genocide expert Alice Wairimu Nderitu told the BBC Darfur was facing a growing risk of genocide as the world's attention remained focused on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.

The current violence has erupted out of a long history of tensions over resources between non-Arab farming communities and Arab pastoralist communities.

The RSF emerged from the Janjaweed militia, which was accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing against non-Arab communities in Darfur in 2003, after rebels took up arms, accusing the government of ignoring the region.

The RSF denies responsibility for recent ethnic cleansing in Darfur, saying it is not involved in what it describes as a "tribal conflict".

How has the world responded to the war?

The UN and other major humanitarian groups have issued several dire warnings about the situation in Sudan, accusing the international community of "forgetting" the African country.

For instance, International Crisis Group has called diplomatic efforts to end the war "lacklustre", while Amnesty International labelled the world's response "woefully inadequate".

Some international bodies have allocated funding to Sudan since the war started. In April, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a €2bn ($2.1bn; £1.7bn) aid pledge from the international community.

Foreign countries have also attempted to organise negotiations between the army and RSF. There have been several rounds of peace talks in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - but all have failed.

The African Union and UN have a shared priority - to establish a ceasefire and bring the army and the RSF together.

BBC News deputy Africa editor Anne Soy reports that both sides, especially the army, have shown an unwillingness to work towards these goals.

At the end of May, the US's request that the army return to peace talks was denied in firm terms.

Are other countries involved in the war?

According to Reuters news agency, UN experts say the RSF has been backed by neighbouring African states including Chad, Libya and South Sudan throughout the war.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been accused of arming the RSF, but the Gulf nation has denied any involvement.

This year, both the UK and the US singled out the UAE in separate appeals for outside countries to stop backing Sudan's warring parties.

There are also reports that Iranian-made armed drones have helped the army regain territory around Khartoum.

Sudanese authorities said Sunday many bodies have been found at the bottom of a well in the capital Khartoum, a few days after the military cleared the area from paramilitaries.

The bodies of 11 people, including women and children, were recovered Saturday from the deep well in the Fayhaa neighborhood of the city, according to police.

Col. Abdul-Rahanan Mohamed Hassan, head of the civil defense’s field team in Khartoum, said a search of the the area was mounted after residents reported that they found a dead body in the well.

"We found inside this well different bodies, males and females, adults and children," Hassan said, adding that authorities were still searching the well.

Police say the victims were killed by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) before being thrown into the well when the paramilitary force was controlling the area. The military retook the area earlier this month as part of its sweeping advances in Khartoum and its sister city of Omdurman.

There was no immediate comment from the RSF.

Afraa al-Hajj Omar, a resident of the nearby Hajj Youssef neighborhood, said that the RSF killed many people in the area and their bodies were left for days in the streets. She said many bodies were thrown in the well. "They robbed us, beat us, and tortured us," she said.

Sudan was plunged into chaos in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare across the country.

Tens of thousands have been killed and the war has driven more than 14 million people from their homes and pushed parts of the country into famine.

The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups.

The war has intensified in recent months, with the military making steady advances against the RSF in Khartoum and elsewhere in the country.

African Union urges member states and international community ‘not to recognise any government or parallel entity’.

The African Union says that the announcement of a parallel government in war-torn Sudan risks severing the country, already ravaged by nearly two years of fighting.

The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been locked in a brutal conflict with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) since April 2023, in a war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and uprooted more than 12 million people.

The war, initially sparked by disagreements over the integration of the RSF into the army, has torn the country apart, with the military now controlling eastern and northern Sudan and the RSF dominating western Darfur and large parts of the south.

The RSF and its allies last month signed a “founding charter” of a breakaway government, in a further sign of the splintering of the country.

Signatories of the document intend to create a “government of peace and unity” in rebel-controlled areas, the AFP news agency reported.

The African Union (AU) on Wednesday warned that the move posed “a huge risk of partitioning of the country”.

It urged all of its member states, as well as the international community, “not to recognise any government or parallel entity aimed at partitioning … the Republic of Sudan or its institutions”.

In a statement, it said the AU “does not recognise the so-called government or parallel entity in the Republic of Sudan”.

On Tuesday, the European Union also reiterated its commitment to the “unity and territorial integrity of Sudan”.

This follows a warning from the United Nations Security Council last week that expressed “grave concerns” over the “founding charter”, adding it could worsen an “already dire humanitarian situation”.

The war in Sudan has upended the impoverished nation.

UN rights chief Volker Turk last month warned that Sudan was “looking into the abyss” and that the country was facing the “biggest displacement crisis in the world”, with millions of people forced from their homes since fighting began.

Meanwhile, nearly 25 million people are suffering from dire food insecurity, 600,000 of whom are “on the brink of starvation”, the UN recently warned.

After two years of war, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and allied groups in Sudan have signed a transitional constitution on Tuesday.

The RSF have been at war against the Sudanese armed forces since April 2023, triggering mass displacements, famine, the deaths of several tens of thousands of people and widespread sexual violence in the country.

The new constitution brings the RSF closer to setting up a parallel government.

The document formally establishes a government and maps out what it describes as a federal, secular state, split into eight regions. Meanwhile, fighting against Sudanese armed forces continued on Tuesday, although the RSF have recently seen their military advances stall.

At the end of February 2025, the armed forces made progress for the first time in two years, edging closer towards retaking control of the capital, Khartoum.

Although the war is unlikely to end any time soon according to experts, the battle for Khartoum could open up a new chapter in the conflict.

Displaced Sudanese families are returning to Omdurman, west of Khartoum, to observe the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, as the city sees signs of recovery after nearly two years of war.

Omdurman was recently reclaimed from Sudanese paramilitary forces, allowing residents to come back to their homes. However, many returnees, like Awad Zayed, found their houses unrecognizable, marked by bullet holes, debris, and destruction.

Despite these challenges, daily life is gradually improving. Local resident Yousef Abdul Qader noted that food prices were initially high, but with roads reopening and supply routes stabilizing, markets are regaining normalcy. “Every day, people return to their homes, and life is gradually returning to normal,” he said.

Charities are also stepping in to support returning families. Gaith Abdul Qader, who runs a community kitchen, said last year Omdurman was nearly empty, but now, his team is feeding dozens of people daily.

Meanwhile, Sudan’s military continues to make gains against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). With advances into Greater Khartoum, military forces are aiming to retake key government institutions, marking a turning point in the conflict that has displaced millions and killed tens of thousands since April 2023.

Title: How a key ingredient in Coca-Cola, M&M's is smuggled from war-torn Sudan

Gum arabic, a vital ingredient used in everything from Coca-Cola to M&M's sweets, is increasingly being trafficked from rebel-held areas of war-torn Sudan, traders and industry sources say, complicating Western companies' efforts to insulate their supply chains from the conflict.

Sudan produces around 80% of the world's gum arabic, a natural substance harvested from acacia trees that's widely used to mix, stabilize and thicken ingredients in mass-market products including L'Oreal lipsticks and Nestle petfood.

The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), at war since April 2023 with Sudan's national army, seized control late last year of the main gum-harvesting regions of Kordofan and Darfur in western Sudan.

Since then the raw product, which can only be marketed by Sudanese traders in return for a fee to the RSF, is making its way to Sudan's neighbors without proper certification, according to conversations with eight producers and buyers who are directly involved in gum arabic trading or based in Sudan.

The gum is also exported through informal border markets, two traders told Reuters.

Asked for comment, a RSF representative said that the force had protected the gum arabic trade and only collected small fees, adding that talk of any lawbreaking was propaganda against the paramilitary group.

Last month, the RSF signed a charter with allied groups establishing a parallel government in the parts of Sudan it controls.

In recent months, traders in countries with lower-gum arabic production than Sudan, such as Chad and Senegal, or which barely exported it before the war, like Egypt and South Sudan, have begun to aggressively offer the commodity at cheap prices and without proof it is conflict-free, two buyers who have been approached by traders told Reuters.

While the acacia trees that yield gum arabic grow across the Africa's arid Sahel region — known as the 'gum belt' — Sudan has become by far the world's biggest exporter due to its extensive groves.

Herve Canevet, Global Marketing Specialist at Singapore-based supplier of specialty food ingredients Eco-Agri, said it was often difficult to determine where gum supplies are coming from as many traders would not say if their product has been smuggled.

"Today, the gum in Sudan, I would say all of it is smuggled, because there's no real authority in the country," he said.

The Association for International Promotion of Gums (AIPG), an industry lobby, said in a January 27 public statement it "does not see any evidence of links between gum [arabic] supply chain and the competing [Sudanese] forces."

However, five industry sources said the opaque new trade in gum risked infiltrating the procurement system of global ingredients makers. Companies like Nexira, Alland & Robert, and Ingredion buy a refined version of the amber-colored gum, turn it into emulsifiers and sell it to big consumer goods firms.

Contacted by Reuters, Ingredion said it works to ensure that all supply chain transactions are fully legitimate and has diversified sourcing since the start of the war to include other countries such as Cameroon.

Nexira told Reuters the civil war prompted it to cut its imports from Sudan and take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of the conflict on its supply chain, including broadening sourcing to ten other countries.

Alland & Robert, Nestle and Coca Cola did not comment. M&Ms maker Mars and L'Oreal did not return requests for comment.

Cheap gum for sale

Mohammed Hussein Sorge, founder of Khartoum-based Unity Arabic Gum, which served global ingredients makers before the war, said he was offered gum arabic in December by traders in Senegal and Chad.

He said the Chad-based traders wanted $3,500 per ton for hashab gum, a more expensive variety of gum arabic primarily produced in Sudan, for which he would normally expect to pay more than $5,000 per ton.

The sellers could not provide a Sedex certification, which ensures buyers a supplier meets sustainable and ethical standards, Sorge also told Reuters.

Sorge did not buy the gum because he feared the low price and lack of documentation was an indication it had been stolen in Sudan or exported via informal RSF-affiliated networks.

"Smugglers manage to smuggle gum arabic through the RSF because the RSF controls all production areas," Sorge said.

Sorge, who fled to Egypt after RSF forces stole his entire gum supply in 2023, shared WhatsApp messages with Reuters showing these gum traders had reached out on five separate occasions, including as recently as Jan. 9.

Since October, the RSF banned exports for 12 goods to Egypt, including gum arabic, in retaliation for what it said was Egyptian airstrikes against the militia.

Asked for comment, the paramilitary said it banned what it called smuggling to Egypt because it was not benefiting Sudan.

A buyer, who declined to be named for safety reasons, recounted how he also was approached by shadowy gum traders.

"I have [acacia] seyal cleaned open quantities ready for shipping," read one WhatsApp message, reviewed by Reuters and offering a load of seyal gum, a cheaper gum arabic variety.

In subsequent WhatsApp messages, the trader proposed to schedule shipping every two months at a negotiable price of $1,950 per metric ton, lower than the $3,000 per ton the buyer said he would expect to pay for this kind of load.

In a different WhatsApp conversation with the same buyer, reviewed by Reuters, a different trader said that trucks carrying gum arabic had crossed the Sudanese border into South Sudan and Egypt.

In all instances, the gum traders could not provide a Sedex certification, the buyer said, adding that he declined the offers for fear the gum came from RSF-affiliated networks.

Changing routes

Before the Sudanese civil war, the raw gum would be sorted in Khartoum and then trucked to Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, to be shipped via the Suez Canal around the world.

Since late last year, however, RSF-affiliated gum arabic started to appear on sale at two informal markets on the border between the Sudanese province of West Kordofan and South Sudan, according to a buyer based in an RSF-controlled area, who declined to be named due to safety concerns.

The buyer, a major trader in the West Kordofan area, said traders collect gum from Sudanese land owners and sell them to South Sudanese traders in these markets for U.S. dollars.

All of this happens with RSF protection, which the traders pay for, the buyer added.

Abdallah Mohamed, a producer who owns acacia groves in West Kordofan, also told Reuters the RSF takes a fee from the traders for protection. The paramilitary group has diversified its interests into gold, livestock, agriculture and banking.

South Sudan Information Minister Michael Makuei, who is also the government's spokesperson, told Reuters transport of gum through South Sudan was not the government's responsibility. Calls and messages to Joseph Moum Majak, the minister of trade and industry for South Sudan, went unanswered.

The RSF also takes the product to the Central African Republic through the border town of Um Dafoog, the buyer said, adding that some goes to Chad.

A wholesale buyer, based outside Sudan, told Reuters the gum was now being exported through Mombasa in Kenya and South Sudan's capital Juba.

Arabic gum of illicit origin has also appeared on sale online. Isam Siddig, a Sudanese gum processor who is now a refugee in Britain, told Reuters his warehouses in Khartoum had been raided by the RSF after he fled in April 2023 with three suitcases of gum in tow.

A year later, his gum products appeared on sale, still in his company's branded packaging, in an online Facebook group according to a screenshot shared with Reuters.

One-year-olds among those raped during Sudan civil war, UN says

7 hours ago Share Save Barbara Plett Usher in Port Sudan & Natasha Booty in London BBC News Share Save

Unicef Hala (not her real name) is one of countless teenagers raped since the war began

Warning: This article contains details of sexual violence that some people may find distressing

Armed men are raping and sexually assaulting children as young as one during Sudan's civil war, says the UN children's agency, Unicef. Mass sexual violence has been widely documented as a weapon of war in the country's nearly two-year conflict. But Unicef's report is the first detailed account about the impact of rape on young children in Sudan. A third of the victims were boys, who typically face "unique challenges" in reporting such crimes and seeking the help they need.

Unicef says that, although 221 rape cases against children have been officially reported since the start of 2024, the true number is likely to be much higher. Sudan is a socially conservative country where huge societal stigma stops survivors and their families from speaking out about rape, as does the fear of retribution from armed groups. The Unicef report provides an appalling window into the abuse of children in the country's civil war. Perhaps its most shocking revelation is that 16 of the victims were under the age of five years, including four infants. Unicef does not say who is responsible, but other UN investigations have blamed the majority of rapes on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), saying RSF fighters had a pattern of using sexual violence to terrorise civilians and suppress opposition to their advances. The RSF, which is fighting this war against its former allies, the Sudanese Armed Forces, has denied any wrongdoing. "The sheer scale of sexual violence we have documented in Sudan is staggering," said Mohamed Chande Othman, chair of the UN's fact-finding mission when its previous report was published in October. According to evidence presented by international human rights groups, victims in the RSF's stronghold of Darfur were often targeted because they were black African rather than Arab, apparently with the aim of driving them out of Sudan. The UN humanitarian response for Sudan is already underfunded. Recent cuts in US aid are expected to reduce programmes to help the victims even further.

Harrowing details in Unicef's report underscore the dire situation. "After nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her," recalls Omnia (not her real name), an adult female survivor who was held by armed men in a room with other women and girls. "Every time they raped her, this girl would come back covered in blood. She is still just a young child. They only release these girls at dawn, and they return almost unconscious. Each of them cries and speaks incoherently. During the 19 days I spent there, I reached a point where I wanted to end my life." As a fractured nation at war, Sudan is one of the most challenging places on earth to access services and frontline workers. The vast number of people displaced by the war has made women and children more vulnerable to attack – three out of four school-age girls are out of school, the UN says.

Trump government cuts end vital help

The devastating outcome of these crimes is aggravated by the fact that victims have few places to turn to for medical help, because many medical facilities have been destroyed, looted or occupied by the warring parties. Recent US aid cuts may be endangering even the limited services available to protect children. Unicef has been providing safe spaces for children through a network of local activists who have set up what are known as Emergency Response Rooms to deal with the crises in their communities. The activists relied quite heavily on US aid, and most have been forced to shut down, according to a Sudanese coordinating committee that monitors them. More broadly, the UN organization dedicated to protecting women's rights says local organisations led by women are vital in delivering support to survivors of sexual violence. But they receive less than 2% of the total funding of the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Fund. The BBC learned that at least one of these local groups, known as "She Leads", was forced to close when US funding was stopped. It was not a big expense, measured in the tens of thousands of dollars, but enabled case workers to reach around 35 survivors a month, said Sulaima Elkhalifa, a Sudanese human rights defender who runs a government unit on combatting violence against woman and helped organize the private initiative. Those who have been raped by armed men "don't have the luxury of being depressed," she told the BBC. The demands of war – finding food, needing to flee – leave no space to deal with trauma, she added.

Title: Egyptian Authorities Reject Attempts to Form Parallel Government in Sudan

Egypt rejected on Sunday attempts aimed at establishing a rival government in Sudan, warning that such moves jeopardised the "unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity" of the war-torn country.

Sudan has been locked in a war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for nearly two years, plunging the country into what the United Nations describes as one of the worst humanitarian disasters in recent memory.

A week ago, the RSF and its allies signed a charter in Kenya declaring the formation of a "government of peace and unity" in areas under their control.

"Egypt expresses its rejection of any attempts that threaten the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of brotherly Sudan, including the pursuit of forming a parallel Sudanese government," a statement from Cairo's foreign ministry said Sunday.

It added that such actions "complicate the situation in Sudan, hinder ongoing efforts to unify political visions and exacerbate the humanitarian crisis".

Egypt also called on "all Sudanese forces to prioritise the country's supreme national interest and to engage positively in launching a comprehensive political (peace) process without exclusion or external interference".

Last week, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty voiced the same stance in a press conference alongside his Sudanese counterpart Ali Youssef.

Red line

"Sudan's territorial integrity is a red line for Egypt," he said, adding that his country "rejects any calls to establish alternative structures outside the current framework".

The paramilitaries' move to form a rival government has drawn sharp criticism, including from UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who warned it would "further deepen Sudan's fragmentation".

Saudi Arabia, which previously mediated ceasefire talks between the warring sides, also rejected the RSF's move.

In a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency on Friday, Riyadh's foreign ministry warned against "any step or illegal measure taken outside the framework of official institutions".

UN condemns RSF's parallel government in Sudan as 'hellscape' emerges

Kuwait echoed that position on Friday, saying it rejected "any unlawful actions taken outside the framework of legitimate state institutions" in Sudan, calling them "a threat to its territorial unity".

At a UN Human Rights Council dialogue on Friday, Saudi Arabia's Gulf neighbour Qatar also expressed its support for "Sudan's unity and territorial integrity".

The United Arab Emirates, which has repeatedly been accused of supplying the RSF with weapons - claims it has denied - has not commented yet.

Sudan — Halima Adam constantly hears about the arrival of relief shipments for those affected by the war via ships docked near her camp in Port Sudan, capital of Red Sea state in eastern Sudan, but she cannot find enough food to meet her needs.

The displaced people face great suffering and have problems with adequate shelters, food, and the severe shortage of potable water. Adam and her seven children receive what she describes as scraps of humanitarian aid, while she cannot buy food from the market due to the crushing high prices in the city. She also does not have any source of income at the present time, as she is a widow.

She told Ayin Network, which is part of the Sudan Media Forum*, last week that the last food ration she received from the Humanitarian Aid Commission was in early June. "It contained one kilogramme of flour and lentils, cooking oil, and some household utensils, and it ran out in just three days, after which we began to rely on community cooking initiatives, and we do not know where the humanitarian aid that comes from abroad goes."

Questions and doubts about the relief coming from abroad are not only on Halima Adam's mind, but it is the case of hundreds of thousands of displaced people sheltering in Port Sudan, who complain about not receiving humanitarian aid rations, and they face the spectre of hunger, and they find no one to answer their urgent questions, where does the aid go?

The governmental Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC**), controlled by the Sudanese army, is responsible for receiving all relief aid coming from abroad and its distribution to the states. Only the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and some Western humanitarian organisations are allowed to deliver aid themselves, according to supervisors and volunteers in the shelters in Port Sudan.

Tragic reality

The issue of aid leaking into the markets is no longer a secret, as carton boxes with the name of the donor and prints 'for free' containing food items such as rice, sugar and wheat flour, are found displayed on store shelves in Port Sudan and many other cities and towns in the country for sale, as repeatedly reported by emergency room volunteers and other activists.

Samya Ahmed (a pseudonym for security reasons), a volunteer in humanitarian aid in Port Sudan, told the Ayin reporter that "HAC and security departments in Port Sudan are transferring the relief shipments to native administration*** leaders in the Jebeit area, east of Port Sudan, which includes a large base for the Sudanese army, and other localities, with the aim of gaining their political loyalty to the current government and silencing their voices".

She said that "Relief items are not only sold in the markets, but also distributed to certain directions for political appeasement, while the displaced people, in whose name humanitarian aid came, face hunger and thirst inside the shelters in Port Sudan. Their lives now depend entirely on aid given by the local community and residents neighbouring the camps, which is scarce compared to their actual need for food."

According to Ahmed, "The government's humanitarian aid authorities are committing a crime against the displaced people. There is no justification for them to go hungry while aid is piling up in warehouses, and other aid is going to those who do not deserve it."

The de facto government controlled by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in Port Sudan, has repeatedly accused its adversary, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of blocking humanitarian routes and obstructing the arrival of aid to various parts of the country, which has led to hundreds of thousands of tons of aid arriving from foreign countries piling up in warehouses, as Minister of Social Development Ahmed Bakheet stated earlier.

However, international organisations accuse the government of obstructing the arrival of aid to various regions in Sudan, especially Kordofan and Darfur.

Recent talks between the army and the Rapid Support Forces in Geneva aimed at reaching a humanitarian ceasefire failed, and further talks are being arranged in Switzerland under US auspices this August.

'Unacceptable behaviour'

Displaced Halima Adam fled her home in Khartoum North (Khartoum Bahri), to Shendi in the north. After months of suffering, she decided to travel to Port Sudan in search of a better living situation, given the presence of the central government offices.

However, she encountered a more tragic reality in the city overlooking the Red Sea coast. "My husband died at the beginning of the war between the army and the RSF, leaving me with seven sons and daughters, without a breadwinner. Since our arrival in Port Sudan, we have been living under difficult humanitarian conditions. There is a severe shortage of food, as HAC officers distribute limited food aid rations that are not enough for our needs for two days."

Port Sudan houses about 239,000 displaced people residing in 34 shelter centres, such as schools and government institutions, according to a tally issued by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan, issued last February.

In the El Ashi shelter centre, the hundreds of families there remained without food for three consecutive days following torrential floods that swept through the centre, which led to the collapse of some tents.

No humanitarian interventions took place, according to what Abdallah, a displaced person residing in the camp, told Ayin.

"We contacted HAC through the supervisors at the centre, asking them to intervene and save our lives, but nothing happened so far. Tents collapsed, and we are now out in the open. Even the simple food supplies, we had, were swept away by the waters, while the security agents at the centre have strictly forbidden us to film the suffering and upload it to social media," he said.

"We did not receive enough relief, as it is distributed after two months, and most of it is expired and damaged, perhaps as a result of long storage. This is unacceptable behaviour, forbidden by religion and law.

"We are hungry and living rough without shelter. We also lack clean drinking water, and medicines are completely non-existent. There are many displaced people who suffer from chronic diseases and do not get the permanent treatments they need. It is a humanitarian tragedy that we have never witnessed in our lives before."

As the war drags on and aid reaches affected people is disrupted, food insecurity rates are rising, with 17.7 million people in Sudan facing acute hunger including five million who have reached the emergency phase of hunger, and 8.5 million people are expected to soon reach the emergency phase of famine as well, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

Leaks

According to Salma (a pseudonym for a volunteer in Port Sudan's emergency rooms), HAC continues to impose restrictions on the work of the emergency rooms, set up by grassroots activists in the neighbourhoods of many cities and towns in Sudan. "They prevent humanitarian organisations from cooperating with us on the pretext that we are not registered with HAC," she told the Ayin Network reporter.

"The emergency rooms volunteers are not allowed access to the shelters for the displaced and distribute aid collected from local charities and shop owners. Instead, HAC even demanded control over this limited social support that volunteers collected from the local residents and merchants, and demanded we hand over the relief items to them.

"There is clear corruption and manipulation in the aid coming from abroad, and we see it in the markets on a daily basis. The displaced people face great suffering and have problems with adequate shelters, food, and the severe shortage of potable water."

Ayin contacted the Sudanese acting Minister of Social Development, Ahmed Bakheet, on the claims of aid being sold in the markets, as humanitarian aid falls under his authority. However, Bakheet answered that "Unfortunately, we cannot speak, because the responsibility of supervising humanitarian work has been transferred to the Prime Minister's Office, so you can knock on the door of Osman Hussein, the head of the assigned council, to answer your questions, or go directly to the HAC commissioner-general".

HAC Commissioner-General Salwa Adam replied to questions of ayin about the allegations of tampering with humanitarian aid coming from abroad, by saying that she "cannot speak because she is outside Sudan at the present time".

#StandWithSudan

* This report was produced as part of the #StandWithSudan campaign launched by the Sudan Media Forum in April this year, to draw attention to the humanitarian disaster, avert famine, and halt violence against civilians in Sudan. It has been published in Arabic simultaneously by 27 press and media institutions and organisations participating in the campaign.

** Under the regime of President Omar Al Bashir (1989-2019), Sudan's then infamous Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) was mostly staffed by security officers who frequently denied access to INGOs and often treated foreign aid workers as western spies.

*** The Native Administration was instituted by British colonial authorities seeking a pragmatic system of governance that allowed for effective control with limited oversight by the state. The state-appointed tribal leaders were also responsible for executing policies, collecting taxes, and mobilising labour on behalf of the central government. The Native Administration during the 30-year rule of dictator Omar Al Bashir reportedly did not represent the real community leaders.

Khashm El Girba / Wad El Helew / El Gash — The Federal Health Ministry reported a rise in cholera cases to 556, with 27 deaths, predominantly in in eastern Sudan's Kassala. The ministry recorded 49 new cases across 16 localities in five states. Despite these concerns, laboratory tests have ruled out monkeypox in Sudan.

In Kassala, a local health report published yesterday, detailed 424 cholera cases and 22 deaths as of August 19. The most affected areas include Wad El Helew with 176 cases, Kassala city with 126 cases, and Khashm El Girba with 81 cases.

To combat the outbreak, a cholera vaccination campaign launched on Monday, coinciding with a polio campaign, which targeted 51,000 people in Wad El Helew. However, the vaccines quickly ran out due to the high number of displaced individuals. Health officials have called for additional supplies to meet the demand.

In a meeting of the Federal Emergency Operations Centre yesterday, leading official, Dr Haitham Mohammed Ibrahim announced an extensive campaign to tackle the cholera epidemic. This includes cooperation with state health ministries, the World Health Organisation, and UNICEF. Detailed daily reports will be prepared to monitor the situation and coordinate efforts.

Dr Mohammed Awad Eljaid disclosed that federal teams are being dispatched to Khashm El Girba and Wad El Helew, with plans to send a third team to El Gedaref.

Floods

The El Gash River swept through Aroma in eastern Sudan's Kassala on Friday, for the second time since the beginning of the rainy season in June. Cholera is spreading in the town. Two people drowned in the river in Kassala city.

Witnesses told Radio Dabanga from Kassala city that a civil defence worker, a woman and a child fell in the raging El Gash on Friday. Only the woman could be rescued.

One of the Ferdous bridges near the irrigation canals south of the city collapsed, and the canals flooded.

Although the level of the El Gash in Kassala city dropped from 290 cm on Friday morning to 220 cm in the evening, experts expect a steady increase of the river's water level in the coming days as rainfall in the Ethiopian Plateau continues. The Climate Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) of the Horn of Africa's Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) expects the rainfall rates in the region to rise until August 21.

Col Badawi Hussein, director of the Civil Defence Police in Kassala and spokesman for the Kassala Rainy Season Emergencies Committee, said in a press statement on Friday that large waves of rainwater arrived from the Eritrean heights, which led to a rapid rise in water levels in the early hours of Friday morning.

Conjunctivitis

The report also highlighted other health issues. Over 2,000 cases of conjunctivitis have been reported in Sudan's Northern state, with additional cases in North Kordofan and West Darfur. A staggering further 8,123 cases of night blindness and 72 maternal deaths were also recorded.

The report indicated that autumn floods have affected 38 new areas, impacting 22,533 families. Malaria cases are rising in seven states, while efforts continue to address environmental health and food control issues.

Title: Cholera Epidemic in White Nile Kills 108 in Four Days

Communities already grappling with the horrors of war face rising tide of cholera (file photo).

Kosti / Rabak — The death toll from the rapidly spreading cholera epidemic in Kosti, White Nile state, rose to 108 on Friday. The federal Ministry of Health reported on Saturday that more than 1,300 cases were recorded the town within three days. "The situation is really alarming," Dr Francis Layoo Ocan, medical referent of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Kosti, said last week. Yet, a vaccination campaign and measures taken by the local authorities seem to help to bring down the number of patients.

Sources in Kosti reported on Saturday that volunteers buried 50 bodies of cholera patients who died in the town, while the Ministry of Health announced the death of 58 others inside the Kosti Teaching Hospital.

The 108 bodies were buried in the Wad Um Jambo cemetery. No numbers have been given concerning the other cemeteries.

The White Nile Emergency Room reported on Saturday that more than 90 cholera cases had been admitted to the teaching hospital of Rabak, the capital of White Nile state, of which eight died.

'Sudden outbreak'

The federal Ministry of Health in Port Sudan announced on Saturday that 1,351 cholera cases were recorded in Kosti within three days last week.

MSF reported in a press release on Friday that more than 800 patients were "being treated for symptoms of acute watery diarrhoea, dehydration, vomiting, and sunken eyes at the Ministry of Health cholera treatment centre in Kosti Teaching Hospital", which is supported by the international medical organisation in White Nile state.

The organisation has been supporting cholera-related responses in Kosti and in Rabak since October 2024.

"Recently, the number of cases had decreased, with some days seeing fewer than 20 patients," the press release says. "However, that suddenly changed on Wednesday night when the first 100 patients arrived at the cholera treatment centre.

"By Friday afternoon, there were over 800 admitted patients. At least two dozen people died at the centre and at least one person was dead on arrival. So far, 48 patients have been discharged. The numbers continue to rise and keeping a detailed tally has become difficult for the team responding."

"The situation is really alarming and is about to get out of control," said Dr Francis Layoo Ocan, MSF's project medical referent in Kosti. "The cholera treatment centre keeps receiving patients in critical condition. We've run out of space, and we are now admitting patients in an open area and treating them on the floor because there are not enough beds."

Contaminated water

The most likely source of infection is the White Nile River, where many families have been collecting water using donkey carts after a major power outage in the area, MSF stated.

The federal Ministry of Health confirmed that contaminated drinking water is the main cause of the epidemic and pointed to the shutdown of the main water station in Kosti after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) targeted the Um Dabaker power station.

The ministry announced on Sunday that the White Nile state authorities have managed to re-open the main water station in Kosti. The Ministry of Health sent 40,000 units of intravenous solutions to the hospital.

The bed capacity of the hospital's isolation centre was increased with the support of the World Health Organisation, UNICEF, MSF, and Plan Sudan, and several Sudanese organisations.

The Sudanese health ministry further stated that "the White Nile state government activated the Public Health Emergency Law and closed markets, shops, and schools on Friday and Saturday, began implementing environmental sanitation campaigns, and applied general health precautions and requirements".

The management of the Kosti Central Market Unit, the main source of all vegetables and fruits that come to the town, closed the market this morning. It will stay closed until Thursday, as a precautionary measure to combat the cholera epidemic.

The Ministry of Health also launched a vaccination campaign to respond to the cholera epidemic. Implemented by the White Nile health promotion department, the campaign continued on Sunday for the third day.

'Noticeable decrease'

The measures seem to help, as the White Nile Emergency Room yesterday announced a noticeable decrease in admissions and deaths at the Kosti Teaching Hospital. 225 cases were admitted to the isolation centre. Fourteen of them died. About 1,000 patients recovered.

Volunteers continue to provide assistance, including providing meals and drinks to the medical staff of Kosti hospital, and intravenous solutions and medicines to the patients.

Displaced

The war that erupted between the Sudanese army and the RSF in mid-April 2023, has led to an extremely large humanitarian crisis. It has placed Sudan among the top four countries globally for the highest prevalence of global acute malnutrition. More than 24 million people, nearly half of the population, are in dire need of food aid.

Moreover, Sudan is battling multiple disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria, dengue fever, measles, and rubella. Medics have warned of the spread of highly contagious epidemics with every wave of displacement, to the point where it would be difficult to control the epidemic. The health authorities are not prepared to receive these large numbers of displaced persons and do not have a plan to combat epidemics and limit their spread, a medic told Radio Dabanga in November last year.

According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in early October last year, more than 17,600 cholera cases and 546 associated deaths were reported in Sudan since the large cholera epidemic that broke out in eastern and northern Sudan in July. In September and October, UNICEF provided more than 1.4 million doses of oral cholera vaccines to Sudan. They would be used to vaccinate 1.81 million people in the then hardest-hit states: El Gedaref, Kassala and River Nile state, states that host large numbers of displaced from Khartoum and El Gezira.

NICEF, partners respond to curb the spread of cholera outbreak

More than 500 children are among the 2,700 cholera cases, that have been reported in Sudan's White Nile State between 1 January and 24 February 2025, according to health authorities. The outbreak has already killed at least 65 people including ten children. In response, UNICEF, together with the Federal Ministry of Health and humanitarian partners, is scaling up a multisectoral response to prevent further spread of the disease and protect vulnerable children.

A major power outage, following attacks on power plants on 16 February, disrupted the water supply in the localities of Kosti and Rabak in the White Nile State, forcing many families to collect untreated water from the White Nile River.

Lack of, or limited access to, safe and clean water combined with significant declines in vaccination rates are further exacerbating the situation and increasing the risk of cholera, especially in overcrowded displacement sites and camps in urban centres. The White Nile State hosts approximately 650,000 internally displaced people in addition to 400,000 refugees. Population movements across at the border with South Sudan add additional challenges to controlling the outbreak.

Cholera is a deadly threat to children and can be fatal within hours if not promptly treated.

"The continued destruction of critical humanitarian infrastructure has left no child safe in this war" said Sheldon Yett, UNICEF Representative to Sudan If children are denied access to clean water, hygiene and sanitation services, as well as information on preventing the spread of cholera, the outbreak will unfortunately continue."

In Kosti, where an estimated 292,000 children are potentially at risk, UNICEF has provided fuel and water treatment chemicals to support the operation of the primary water treatment plant, securing access to safe drinking water for approximately 150,000 people. In the affected localities, UNICEF and partners are also delivering lifesaving water, sanitation, and hygiene supplies to provide access to clean water, enhance good practices and UNICEF is engaging communities, through dialogues and social media, to disseminate key messaging on the causes, symptoms, and prevention of cholera.

On 21 February, the Sudanese Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF launched a six-day cholera vaccination campaign in the localities of Kosti and Rabak in White Nile. The campaign aims to reach over 1 million people with oral cholera vaccines. UNICEF has supplied cholera treatment kits and is supporting deployment of frontline workers to Cholera Treatment Centres to bolster treatment. UNICEF is also supporting the training of public health officers in infection prevention control and of community members to monitor the situation on the ground.

"Disease outbreaks, such as this surge of cholera, can push the already fragile healthcare system and weakened sanitation and hygiene infrastructure to their breaking point. While we invest in responding to this emergency now, we must invest in strengthening the systems underpinning the services children need," said Yett.

Notes for editors:

UNICEF urgently needs an additional US$ 750,000 to fund an emergency cholera response in the White Nile State in the areas of health, water, hygiene, sanitation, and social and behaviour change to curb the spread of the outbreak and prevent loss of life.

To date, more than 35,000 people have benefitted from the WASH supplies UNICEF and partners have distributed, including household water treatment chemicals to curb community transmission, the deployment of water chlorinators across water points to provide safe drinking water, and mobilization of rapid response teams to support water chlorination, conduct disinfection activities, and disseminate hygiene messages at the household level.

In Sudan, the national vaccination coverage has plummeted from 85 per cent before the war to approximately 50 percent. In active conflict zones the immunization rates are averaging at 30 per cent, a critically low rate of coverage.

Since the beginning of the cholera outbreak, officially declared on 12 August 2024, more than 55,000 cases and over 1,500 deaths were reported across 12 of 18 states in Sudan.

In response to the cholera outbreak in Sudan, UNICEF has delivered over 13.7 million doses of oral cholera vaccines since 2023, including over 9.2 million doses in 2024 and nearly 1.6 million doses in 2025. In addition to vaccines, UNICEF has extensively supported the procurement and delivery of critical supplies to Sudan, including oral rehydration salts, water purification tablets, acute watery diarrhoea kits and water tanks, both locally and offshore.

The Sudanese military is intensifying its efforts to reclaim the capital, Khartoum, from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), but the battle is coming at a devastating cost, particularly for the country's children. As fighting rages on, young lives are being torn apart by violence, hunger, and injury.

In the hospital in Omdurman, a heart breaking scene unfolds as a young girl screams in pain from severe burns caused by an explosion. Her mother, Khadija, is also badly burned after pulling her daughter to safety. The family managed to survive the shelling, but they have lost everything, and Khadija struggles to afford even basic care, unable to pay for her daughter's bandages.

The hospital is overflowing with child patients, many suffering from war-related injuries, malnutrition, and sickness. According to Dr. Maha Hussein, the Director-General of the hospital, the ongoing war with the RSF has led to a flood of children in need of urgent medical attention.

One mother, whose child is severely malnourished, describes the heart breaking situation:

"He just won't gain any weight. We measure him in grams. His older brothers have become violent—obsessed with fighting and naming different types of guns."

As the conflict deepens, the trauma extends beyond physical wounds. Girls in the region are learning self-defence drills, preparing themselves for the threat of sexual violence and enslavement at the hands of the RSF.

Meanwhile, in another devastating incident, shelling has killed an entire family—eight people, including four children, were killed in a single strike. Hussam, a volunteer mortician, is left to process the grim aftermath. “We’re grown-ups. We’ve found all we need in the world, but why were they involved? They were innocent,” he says, visibly shaken by the loss.

Since the war between the Sudanese military and the RSF erupted in April 2023, the conflict has been marked by atrocities, including ethnically motivated killings and widespread rape. The United Nations and human rights groups have condemned these actions, and the International Criminal Court is now investigating potential war crimes and crimes against humanity.

As the fighting continues to escalate, the civilian toll grows ever heavier, with children at the heart of this devastating conflict.

People have taken to the streets in Sudan to protest against the military coup.

The military has dissolved civilian rule, arrested political leaders and declared a state of emergency. The coup leader, Gen Abdel Fattah Burhan, has blamed political infighting.

Large numbers poured on to the streets of the capital, Khartoum, demanding the return of civilian rule.

More are expected to join the protests after calls for action by political parties and professional unions.

Title: Sudan: Jubilation After Sudanese Army Retakes Strategic City Near Khartoum

Widespread celebrations were reported on Sunday in Wad Madani, a regional capital on the Blue Nile River about 85 miles/135 kilometers southeast of the capital Khartoum, following the retaking of the city by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). The army has been making steady advances in the area in recent weeks.

"Wad Madani holds immense strategic importance, positioned at the crossroads of key supply routes between several states and serving as the nearest major city to Khartoum" reports Radio Dabanga, an independent news agency broadcasting via satellite, shortwave radio and the internet. "The capital remains a focal point of the conflict, with fierce fighting continuing since the war erupted in April 2023."

Mohamed 'Hemedti' Dagalo, commander of paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which international organizations have accused of genocide across Sudan's Darfur region, acknowledged the setback but vowed to step up the fighting to recapture lost ground. RSF has controlled the city since December 2023.

Sudanese organizations, as well as international diplomats, emphasize that both rival forces are motivated by a lust for power and are vying for Sudan's resources, including gold. Both have participated in blocking essential food and medical aid and to the dire conditions that make Sudan the world's largest humanitarian disaster.

The Al Jazirah Monitor, a Sudanese human rights group, reported that the army freed a large number of prisoners in appalling condition after they were denied access to food and medical treatment during their detention. The SAF made further advances towards Khartoum on Sunday, according to reporting by Sudan Tribune.

Wad Madani is "vitally important", Mohanad Elbalal, Sudanese analyst and co-founder of Khartoum Kitchen said in a series of posts on the social media platform X, explaining "why the exuberant celebrations you are seeing across Sudan are justified" - despite the reality that the Sudanese army has also perpetrated widespread human rights abuses, according to multiple observers.

The Wad Madani city locality is ordinarily home to 700,000 people. Its liberation is a huge deal for its people, of course, but its strategic importance means today's liberation is significant for the entirety of the 50 million people who live in Sudan. Wad Madani isn't just the capital of Gezira State, it's the HQ for administering the Gezira Scheme which is the backbone of Sudan's agricultural sector.

RSF control of Gezira State led to the first comprehensive failure of the farming scheme since it was established a century ago. The liberation of Wad Madani and the prospect of getting the scheme back operating will have a significant impact for a Country facing the real prospect of wide scale famine.

Wad Madani is also the base of the Army's 1st infantry division. The division is responsible for securing Al Gezira, which is the 2nd most populous state in Sudan with 6 million+ residents also happens to be one of the smallest Army divisions and least battle prepared.

Dabanga / File photo: SAF SAF commander Lt Gen El Burhan greets members of the First Infantry Division in Wad Madani, capital of El Gezira, on December 3, 2023

The reason for this Is due to the fact that Al Gezira has no international borders and as the heart of the historically stable Central Sudan region it was never prioritised. This led to the calamity almost a year ago where the RSF were able to capture the base as well as the city and with it the majority of Gezira State in a very short period of time. The re-enforced army that has retaken Wad Madani will now be in a strong position to rapidly retake ground across Al Gezira.

A final and very important reason is logistics, both military and civilian. The Sudanese highway network passes through Wad Madani. For the Army to be able to project power in Western Sudan and compete with the UAE arms supply route via Darfur, it needed first to reestablish a supply route into Kordufan (Western Sudan) which the RSF until recently had been able to choke off at Wad Madani.

The 5th Army division based in North Kordufan is widely considered to be the most capable division in the Sudanese Army but up until recently has only been able to exert control over its base city of El Obeid because there was no effective way of supplying it. If the Army supply lines reach El Obeid, then the 5th infantry division will be able to project control over the wider surrounding area. The reconnection of the National highway at Wad Madani will also help reduce transport costs and help facilitate trade.

To sum up the majority of the 6 million residents of Al Gezira are likely to be liberated as a result of the Army entering Wad Madani. The restarting of the Gezira will help mitigate the acute hunger crisis currently being experienced in Sudan.

And lastly control of the logistic choke point of Wad Madani will allow the Army to project its force into Western Sudan where the RSF militia currently has the logistical upper hand.

According to reporting from Wad Mahani following the SAF takeover, a warehouse was found in the city with a large cache of ammunition and missiles from the United Arab Emirates, which is widely regarded as the chief RSF backer. Last week, the U.S. government announced sanctions against UAE companies accused of procuring arms for RAF and also sanctioned the RSF leader,

CNN —

This week, the United States accused the RSF militia in Sudan’s brutal civil conflict of committing genocide.

It’s the second time in two decades that genocide has been declared in the northeast African nation, where thousands have died and millions are in the grip of a humanitarian crisis.

How did the country get here?

For 20 months, two of Sudan’s most powerful generals – Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, leader of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, who heads the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) – have viciously competed for territory in a country still reeling from the massacre of tens of thousands of people in the early 2000s and the displacement of millions more.

The two men – former allies – jointly ousted President Omar al-Bashir from office in 2019. Together, they also contributed to another coup in 2021 when al-Burhan seized power from the country’s transitional government.

Today, Sudan is riven by conflict, with the RSF believed to be in control of much of the country’s western and central regions, including Darfur and parts of the capital Khartoum.

More than 11 million people have been internally displaced since the fighting erupted in April 2023, according to the United Nations, while millions more have fled Sudan.

Hunger is widespread and famine conditions are now present in several areas of the country, the UN has warned.

Who has been cited as responsible?

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Hemedti’s RSF and its allied Arab militias had perpetrated “direct attacks against civilians” including the systematic murder of “men and boys – even infants – on an ethnic basis.”

They also “deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,” Blinken said, adding that the same forces “targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.”

“Based on this information, I have now concluded that members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan,” he announced.

The RSF described the decision by the US as “unjust,” adding in a statement on its Telegram channel that “the State Department’s claim that the RSF committed genocide in Sudan is inaccurate.”

“The decision fails to specify the group against which the alleged genocide was committed or the location of the genocide … The decision vaguely refers to the Sudanese people, of whom RSF fighters and supporters are an integral part,” the RSF statement said.

The RSF has a history connected to ethnic-driven violence. The paramilitary group grew out of the Arab Janjaweed militia that oversaw the genocide of the early 2000s. That carnage left an estimated 300,000 people dead.

Since fighting erupted in mid-April 2023 between the RSF and the SAF, ethnically motivated killings have intensified, particularly in the western Darfur region. This mirrors the pattern of targeted killings that typified the first genocide.

West Darfur witnessed some of its worst ethnic-related killings in 2023, when hundreds of people from non-Arab ethnic groups were massacred by the RSF and forces linked to it. On Tuesday, the US imposed sanctions on their leader Hemedti, “for his role in systematic atrocities committed against the Sudanese people,” and sanctioned seven RSF-linked companies and one individual “for their roles in procuring weapons for the RSF.”

Are both warring factions complicit in abuses?

In September last year, a United Nations fact-finding mission accused both the SAF and the RSF of complicity in war crimes.

And in his statement, Blinken laid blame for abuses at the door of both parties. “The United States does not support either side of this war, and these actions against Hemedti and the RSF do not signify support or favor for the SAF,” he said. “Both belligerents bear responsibility for the violence and suffering in Sudan and lack the legitimacy to govern a future peaceful Sudan.”

Sudanese activist, Hala Al-Karib, who heads the regional arm of the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, told CNN that her organization had documented cases of sexual violence and sexual exploitation allegedly committed by fighters from both the SAF and the RSF.

In Darfur, she said, where she has worked for over 20 years, sexual violence has been “used as a tool of terror to force communities to submit to the RSF,” – a pattern seen in previous conflicts that has been replicated by the militia group, she claimed.

“It’s the same method and strategy,” she said of the alleged sexual crimes. “It’s also used for retaliation in their war against SAF and it has ethnic elements to it.”

Al-Karib said that between October and January, her organization had handled cases of at least 10 girls, some as young as 14, who took their own lives after being gang-raped by RSF militia men in Sudan’s Al Jazira state. This had followed the defection of an RSF commander in the area to SAF, she said.

“The RSF has been completely emboldened by impunity, a lack of accountability, and the fact that they were not seriously subjected to any sort of accountability,” she said, welcoming the US sanctions against Hemedti.

Civilians and aid agencies have also borne the brunt of frequent shelling and staged raids by the Sudanese army and the RSF – targeting civilian areas and causing multiple casualties.

Last month, more than 100 people were killed after bombs fell on a crowded market in North Darfur. In the same month, three staff members of the World Food Programme (WFP) were killed in an airstrike on the agency’s office in Blue Nile State, wrapping up “the deadliest year on record for aid workers in Sudan,” the UN said.

Dozens of airstrikes with multiple fatalities are reported daily by Sudanese media. A senior procurement official who led the SAF’s acquisition of arms was sanctioned by the US last October.

The RSF and the Sudanese military typically blame one each other for such attacks, with a recent statement from the RSF criticizing the US for overlooking “widespread atrocities committed by the SAF, including aerial bombardments that have claimed the lives of more than 4,000 civilians.”

CNN has reached out the Sudanese government on the matter but has not yet received a response.

What is the impact on civilians?

Before the deadly power tussle erupted between the SAF and the RSF, Sudan already ranked among the world’s poorest countries with decades of conflict hindering its economic growth.

Their war, now in its second year, has displaced more than 11 million people within Sudan, while some 3.2 million others have fled to neighboring countries, according to UN figures.

Some of those unable to flee are harbored in Darfur’s Zanzam camp, where famine was declared last month. The camp, home to around half a million displaced people, has also come under RSF bombardment.

Hunger in Darfur has sometimes forced people to eat “grass and peanut shells” to survive, the then WFP regional director for Eastern Africa, Michael Dunford, said last year, amid warnings by the UN that some 26 million Sudanese were facing acute hunger.

Food deliveries to Darfur resumed last August after a key border crossing was reopened by authorities for aid to enter Sudan. But in parts of Darfur, aid organizations are still impeded by restrictions and famine conditions area spreading to additional areas, a UN report said this week.

On Friday, humanitarian group Médecins Sans Frontières, or, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it was suspending activities at one of the last operating hospitals in the RSF-controlled south Khartoum, citing recurring attacks from armed fighters.

“The medical needs are overwhelming. Injuries are often horrific. Mass casualty incidents have become almost routine,” MSF’s Emergency Coordinator, Claire San Filippo said in a statement.

How has the world responded to the war?

The Sudanese conflict has been largely overshadowed by hostilities in other parts of the world such as in Ukraine and Gaza, International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva said last year.

However, warring factions in the African nation have also defied global efforts to end the conflict.

Last month, Blinken told the UN Security Council that foreign actors were fueling the war in Sudan, but he did not name who they were.

“To the foreign sponsors sending drones, missiles, mercenaries – enough. To those profiting off the illicit oil and gold trade that fund this conflict – enough,” he said.

Sudan’s military government has frequently accused the United Arab Emirates of arming the RSF, but the Gulf nation denies this. The seven RSF-linked companies that were sanctioned by the US on Tuesday are all based in the UAE.

In a statement to CNN, the UAE Foreign Ministry said: “The UAE has made absolutely clear that it is not providing any support or supplies to any of the two belligerent warring parties in Sudan. Our primary focus remains on addressing the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Sudan. We continue to call for an immediate ceasefire and a peaceful resolution to this man-made conflict.”

A CNN investigation in 2023 found evidence that Russian mercenary group Wagner had been arming the RSF. The militia and the then Wagner leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, denied this at the time.

In November, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that called on Sudan’s warring factions to end the fighting, strengthen protections for civilians and allow the delivery of humanitarian aid. Sudan’s military-backed foreign ministry welcomed Russia’s action, saying the UN resolution undermined Sudan’s sovereignty.

Will the US genocide determination make a difference?

Sudanese lawyer Mutasim Ali told CNN that the US’ determination of genocide in Sudan was “long overdue” and should have happened sooner.

Nonetheless, it is “a form of justice because it recognizes victims’ grievances,” he said.

“It is a step towards peace and accountability by paving the way to hold actors responsible to account, not only perpetrators themselves but actors complicit in genocide,” added Ali, a legal adviser at the Canada-based Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights.

For activist Al-Karib, US sanctions against Hemedti and the declaration of genocide could be crucial in not only reining in his militia but also curbing the support he receives from foreign actors.

“We don’t think that the scale of these atrocities happening in Sudan and Darfur would have been this big without the support of the UAE to the RSF,” she said.

“So, we hope that the US decision to sanction Hemedti will send a strong message to the UAE to rethink its position and engage in a serious political process to end these atrocities and genocidal acts happening across the country.”

Washington D.C. — The US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed sanctions on Abdelfattah El Burhan, the commander-in-chief of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and chairperson of Sudan's Transitional Sovereignty Council. This move follows the designation of Rapid Support Forces (RSF) commander Mohamed 'Hemedti' Dagalo to the sanctions list on January 7.

In a press release yesterday, the Treasury Department accused the SAF, under Burhan's leadership, of deadly attacks on civilians, including airstrikes on protected sites such as schools, markets, and hospitals. The SAF has also been charged with deliberately denying humanitarian access and using food as a weapon of war.

OFAC's designation, issued under Executive Order 14098, identifies Burhan as a foreign individual leading an entity that threatens Sudan's peace, security, and stability.

In December 2023, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined that SAF members had committed war crimes. The US government has accused the SAF and RSF of creating one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, citing the declaration of famine in five areas of Sudan.

"The SAF has violated international humanitarian law and ignored commitments made in the 2023 Jeddah Declaration of Commitment to Protect the Civilians of Sudan," Blinken said in a press statement. "The SAF's use of food deprivation as a tactic of war and its deliberate obstruction of emergency humanitarian aid have contributed to the world's largest humanitarian crisis.

"El Burhan has also obstructed the advancement of peace, refusing to participate in international ceasefire talks in Switzerland in August 2024 and hindering the political transition to civilian government."

Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo echoed these sentiments. "Today's action underscores our commitment to seeing this conflict end. The United States will continue to use our tools disrupt the flow of weapons into Sudan and hold leaders accountable for their blatant disregard of civilian lives," he said in the press release.

Burhan, along with Hemedti, led the October 2021 military coup that overthrew Sudan's civilian-led transitional government. "Since then, Burhan has opposed a return to civilian governance in Sudan and has refused to participate in international peace talks to end the fighting, choosing war over good-faith negotiation and de-escalation", the Treasury stated.

Earlier this month, the US accused Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of committing genocide and imposed sanctions on its leader, RSF Commander Mohamed 'Hemedti' Dagalo.

DIS sanctions

OFAC has also targeted Sudan's Defense Industries System (DIS), the SAF's main procurement arm, which has been under sanctions since June 2023. The latest sanctions target Ahmed Abdallah, a Sudanese-Ukrainian official at DIS, and Portex Trade Limited, a Hong Kong-based company controlled by Abdallah.

According to OFAC, since the DIS was sanctioned, it has sought to bypass restrictions by using private companies to procure arms. Abdallah, as Portex's chief operating officer, coordinated the purchase of Iranian-made drones from an Azerbaijani defence company for delivery to Sudan. Both Abdallah and Portex have been designated for their roles in these activities.

As reported by Radio Dabanga in October last year, OFAC sanctioned Mirghani Idris Suleiman, director of the Sudanese Defence Industries System (DIS).

There has never been a more apt time to push for the dismantling of military hegemony and the installing of fully civilian, democratic governance in Sudan.

On October 30, millions of people took to the streets across Sudan to protest against the army’s October 25 coup. The massive protest was perhaps the largest the world has seen outside Hong Kong in recent years. Since then, successive anti-coup protests have drawn large crowds across the country, despite increasing violence from the coup regime. This Wednesday’s protest, where at least 17 protesters were killed, was only the latest chapter in a continuing battle for the political soul, and future, of the country.

On the one side, there are myriad civilian forces, including the neighbourhood resistance committees, pro-democracy activists, the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC) and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. On the other, there are several paramilitary forces, some former rebel armed groups, the remnants of toppled dictator Omar al-Bashir’s patronage network, and most importantly, the military.

Since a failed coup attempt in late September, followed by a cavalcade of public conferences, mass protests, and an increasingly fluid political situation, Sudan’s previously highly heterogenous political scene became somewhat bipolar. The October 25 coup followed by consolidations in a newly set-up Sovereign Council has divided Sudan into two distinct camps: those who are anti-coup, and those who are supportive of it. And there is reason to believe, despite the events of the past few weeks, that the anti-coup side has the upper hand.

Military fatigue(s)

Last month’s coup was orchestrated by four unlikely allies – Head of the Sovereign Council Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, his deputy General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo known as “Hemedti”, Minister of Finance Gibreil Ibrahim, and Governor-General of Darfur Mini Minawi. And this “Coup Quartet” is unlikely to remain united, or gain the trust of the Sudanese public, for multiple reasons.

The tensions between Burhan and Hemedti are well known and have caused divisions within Burhan’s troops. While the generals are currently acting together, it is clear that they both supported the coup to pursue their own personal interests. The same is true for Ibrahim and Minawi, former rebels, whose insistence that they have not been included in transitional structures and processes despite holding positions within the transitional government provided the pretext for the coup. In this context, the coup appears to be a vehicle to allow its orchestrators to resist the growing pressures on them to cede power and/or financial interest, rather than a mechanism to, as its supporters claim, “correct past mistakes”.

In the aftermath of the October 25 coup, Burhan said he dissolved the government merely to avert civil war after civilian politicians “stoked hostility to the armed forces”. He claimed he will appoint a “technocrat” prime minister to rule alongside the military within days and put the country back on the path towards democracy. Burhan has since sworn himself in as the head of a new Sovereign Council and handpicked civilians loyal to him, and the Islamist movement, as civilian members.

He and his supporters, however, will have difficulty convincing the Sudanese public, and the international community, that they will deliver democratic gains – in the form of free and fair elections – through such anti-democratic methods. Indeed, there are several outstanding issues that signal the military may have overestimated its governing capabilities.

First, it is doubtful that General Burhan will be able to give his coup the necessary constitutional legitimacy to lure any technocrats into participating in the new civilian-military government he has promised to form.

Second, with almost all political parties vocally rejecting the coup, it is difficult to see which constituencies the new government can claim to represent, aside from the Islamists, sworn enemies of regional military allies Egypt and the UAE.

Third, it is not clear how a “coup government”, even if it includes technocrats, would be able to convince the public that it will meaningfully tackle the difficult issues of transitional justice, corruption, and human rights abuses when the military is largely seen as complicit in all three.

Fourth, the military’s regional allies Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, who see their relations with Sudan mostly through a security lens, will find it difficult to continue to support the coup, politically and financially, in the face of mounting international condemnation.

To overcome these seemingly impossible to resolve issues, the Coup Quartet have been pressuring Prime Minister Hamdok, whose acquiescence they see as a gateway to legitimacy, to join their government. But the prime minister – still under house arrest and undoubtedly aware of the mass detentions and deaths following the coup – unsurprisingly continues to decline their offer.

The putschists have also embarked on a crackdown on pro-democracy voices in the Sudanese media and civil society, called for a return to subsidies, and strong-armed groups in the east of the country to comply with orders to open Sudan’s largest port, all to gain the support of the Sudanese public.

However, all their efforts appear to have been in vain. The Coup Quartet fails to see that after concerns over civilian autonomy in recent years, the Sudanese people would accept neither a new political dispensation where they have less, not more, power, nor the unconstitutional instalment of a new prime minister more palatable to the military.

Now, with the coup on shakier ground, there are some important questions facing Sudan: Should the country go back to the August 2019 agreement? Could it? What will Hamdok’s next move be? Will the positions of other members of the Coup Quartet change? How will different civilian groups be represented in future mediation efforts?

Change from below

The Sudanese street, an amorphous, but well-organised bloc, has shown in no uncertain terms that it will not readily accept a return to the previous status quo.

But it also learned from the 2018 Revolution how important it is to state not only what it stands against, but also what it stands for – and today it is doing just that. The civilians on the streets made their core demand clear: They want a fully civilian government to be set up immediately to take the country out of this crisis.

The reasons behind this stance are obvious.

Advertisement

First, history: the previous model, which represented a compromise between the military and civilians, has ultimately paved the way to the current crisis. Therefore, many believe alternatives, difficult though they may be to achieve, must be sought.

Second, pragmatism: the hybrid government model, and its less-than-perfect decision-making mechanisms, stilted the progress around big-ticket issues, such as transitional justice, the dismantling of al-Bashir’s networks, and the setting-up of important institutions like parliament and key commissions. As a result, many perceive the current crisis as an opportunity to abandon a governance model that was not working.

Third, leverage: The civilians have momentum and a fairly united position, so they believe making any compromise, or taking a step back at this point would be ill-advised and a betrayal of the sacrifices made to get to this position.

Moreover, the street, which is arguably the most astute political actor in the current Sudanese political scene, senses that the coup is on weak footing, and has been since the start. So far, no political parties bar Gibreil Ibrahim’s Justice and Equality Movement, have avowed the coup and many under consideration for the top job have publicly distanced themselves from the coup, sensing, rightly, that any association with such an unconstitutional move and with the unpopular Coup Quartet, would be a serious political and social misstep. In the face of all this, the only constituency that has backed the coup are deposed Islamists and their economic and security backers, most of whom are returning to the political stage after the coup.

Breaking the impasse

The generals behind the coup, realising they are on shaky ground, agreed to initial mediation so long as it does not include the FFC political umbrella. As a result, Prime Minister Hamdok emerged as the only visible, if restrained, civilian negotiator in the process. But he eventually engaged the FFC on an offer, effectively ending all mediation. The offer, which would have seen Hamdok installed into the Sovereign Council, would have been widely unpopular, and was refused. Burhan has since gone ahead and fashioned the Council out of military and civilian sympathisers and former rebels who say they were not consulted, but will retain their constitutional positions and push for a return to constitutional order.

Meanwhile, resistance committees have pledged to continue with protests and acts of civil disobedience until their demands are met. They acknowledged that the race towards democracy is a marathon, not a sprint – with some even seeing the current crisis as a continuation of the 2018 revolution, against the same actors: the military and the Islamists.

The street has shown it is ready and willing to play the long game and unwilling to agree to a compromise that would result in another coup down the line. While the crisis deepens, the international community, in trying to figure out which pressure points to press to reach a solution, should absolutely respect the street’s resolve.

Consultations by mediators with pro-democracy protesters seem fixated on yet another civilian compromise that sees the military retain enough power, without meaningfully reforming the very structures and pathways that enable them to hold Sudan’s future hostage.

International mediators acknowledge that young Sudanese protesters are critical political actors, who manage to mobilise millions of people without telecoms or internet connections. Nevertheless, many still consider them naive political operatives not realistic about what is possible.

Reconciling this disconnect requires international actors to overcome their profound crisis of consultation. Their discussions are often limited to those with political and urban elites whose views often diverge, sometimes radically, from the street. Popular consultations and renegotiations on modalities of power, made in collaboration with the street, may be messy, but this is not the time for political expediency that undermines popular will.

Despite the similarity in dynamics to 2019, supporters of democratic transition should be pushing for a new political dispensation, rather than a return to the 2019 agreement. This will require stakeholders and mediators to develop entirely new thinking around reaching solutions that are process, not result, oriented. That requires an approach that centres the locus of popular power where it clearly is: on the streets.

There has never been a more apt time to push for the dismantling of military hegemony and the installing of fully civilian, democratic governance in Sudan.

The Horn of Africa and Sahel regions, which Sudan straddles, could do with an example of democratic success, amid its current fragility. Ultimately, democratic processes require democratic custodians, and in Sudan, there is already one such custodian: the street.

Army takes control of RSF territories in Mansoura, Murabaat and Elfitihab, and seizes weapons and ammunition depot.

Sudan‘s military forces claim to have advanced into the country’s second-largest city Omdurman, taking some areas previously controlled by rival rebel group, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

Fighting was reported to be raging in the city, which sits directly across the Nile River from the capital, Khartoum, for a second day on Wednesday. The army has now seized control of former RSF territories in Mansoura, Murabaat and Elfitihab, according to Hiba Morgan, Al Jazeera’s Sudan correspondent.

The campaign in Omdurman is part of a new phase of the war that erupted in April 2023, with fighting heavily concentrated in Khartoum and the last contested state in the sprawling western region of Darfur. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions.

In a social media post, our correspondent said RSF fighters have been deploying drones to try to halt the military’s gains.

The Sudan Tribune also confirmed the advance, adding that three army officers had been freed from captivity.

It reported that government soldiers had seized a weapons and ammunition depot maintained by the RSF, as well as storage facilities containing flour and sugar.

Brigadier General Nabil Abdallah told the outlet that the release of the three officers followed a special operation, which killed up to 20 RSF fighters, including a commander.

Al Jazeera could not independently verify the statement.

The military gains come after the United States determined that the RSF had “committed genocide” in Sudan and imposed sanctions on its leader, Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo.

International agencies have accused both the RSF and government forces of atrocities and war crimes.

Sudan has been torn apart and pushed towards famine by the war that erupted 21 months ago, making the country the scene of the world’s largest internal displacement crisis.

A civil war in Sudan that has killed 150,000 people and forced more than 11 million others from their homes, by some estimates, prompted the U.S. government on Tuesday to declare that a genocide had been perpetrated by one of the war’s main antagonists, the ethnic Arab militia known as the Rapid Support Forces.

The war, which has drawn in foreign countries and a host of armed groups, now threatens to spill over Sudan’s borders. After 21 months of fighting, thousands have been killed in a campaign of ethnic cleansing, countless women and girls have been subjected to sexual violence, and millions are hungry, in the world’s first officially declared famine since 2020.

So many people have been uprooted that the United Nations says Sudan is now home to the world’s largest displacement crisis — a “living nightmare,” in the words of Amy Pope, director general of the U.N.’s International Organization for Migration.

Genocide Old and New

The Sudanese army chief, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the commander of the Rapid Support Forces, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, were once allies. In 2021, they worked together to stage a military coup. But they later split after failing to merge their forces.

Sudan coup: Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok resigns after mass protests

Getty Images Pro-democracy protesters faced another violent crackdown from the military

Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has resigned after another day of mass protests rocked the capital Khartoum.

Thousands marched against a recent deal he had done to share power with the army, who staged a coup in October.

Chanting "power to the people", protesters called for a return to full civilian rule. But military forces again responded with force, leaving two people dead.

Mr Hamdok's decision to quit leaves the army in full control.

It is another blow to Sudan's fragile attempts at a transition to democratic rule after a popular uprising led to the overthrow of Sudan's long-term authoritarian President Omar al-Bashir in 2019.

In a televised address, Mr Hamdok said the country was at a "dangerous turning point that threatens its whole survival".

He said he had tried his best to stop the country from "sliding towards disaster", but that "despite everything that has been done to reach a consensus... it has not happened".

Civilian and military leaders had made an uneasy power-sharing agreement after the army staged a coup on 25 October and initially placed Prime Minister Hamdok under house arrest.

The country was just one month away from transition to a civilian head of state when the army seized power.

Mr Hamdok, an economist by training, is widely respected in the international community having previously worked as an official with the United Nations. He helped negotiate a deal to forgive some of Sudan's debts but this involved removing fuel subsidies, leading the prices of many basic goods to rise, and to anti-government protests.

Under the agreement reached with Mr Hamdok in November, the reinstated prime minister was supposed to lead a cabinet of technocrats until elections were held. But it was unclear how much power the new civilian government would have, and protests against the military resumed, which were often violently suppressed.

Protests continued even after Mr Hamdok had returned to office, with some demonstrators saying that his reinstatement was helping to legitimatise the military takeover.

The United Nations' special representative in Sudan has expressed regret over Mr Hamdok's resignation. It puts at risk progress made since the December revolution when Mr Bashir was toppled, Volker Perthes warned.

The resignation of Mr Hamdok showed the military was losing their leverage to get international recognition and popular support, according to a spokesman for the opposition Sudanese Congress Party.

Further protests against the military are planned for Tuesday. Activists have told people to march to the presidential palace in the capital city, "until victory is achieved", according to the AFP news agency.

Thousands of people were on the streets of the capital Khartoum and the city of Omdurman on Sunday, chanting and calling on the military to leave politics.

More than 50 people have been killed during protests since the coup, including at least two on Sunday, according to the pro-democracy Sudan Central Doctors' Committee.

Coup leader Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has defended last October's coup, saying the army had acted to prevent a civil war. He says Sudan is still committed to the transition to civilian rule, with elections planned for July 2023.

Analysis by Emmanuel Igunza, BBC News

January 1 marked Sudan's Independence Day but there's little to celebrate in the country at the moment.

The resignation of PM Abdalla Hamdok is a big blow to the military leaders who had thought an agreement with Mr Hamdok would appease protesters and legitimize their stay in power.

Clearly those calculations were wrong. But it means the army are now firmly in power, reversing gains made as the country attempted to return to civilian rule.

The current political crisis now threatens to return Sudan to the authoritarian years of former ousted leader Omar al-Bashir.

And there's also the risk that the country could go back to being a pariah state with the likes of the US already indicating that they would sanction those impeding a return to civilian rule.

Given Sudan's economic struggles, that could have an even worse effect on the lives of Sudanese people.

Sudan coup: Why Omar al-Bashir was overthrown

15 April 2019 Share Save Share Save

Sudan protests: So what's going on?

Sudan's deposed President Omar al-Bashir is under arrest after being overthrown by the military following months of protests - and the coup leader himself announced his resignation just 24 hours after taking charge. Here's what you need to know.

How did it all begin?

In December 2018, the government tried to stave off economic collapse brought on by years of US sanctions and loss of oil revenue by imposing emergency austerity measures and a sharp currency devaluation.

Cuts to bread and fuel subsidies sparked demonstrations in the east over living standards, but the anger soon spread to the capital, Khartoum.

The lifting of most sanctions in 2017 failed to help the country, which had lost most of its oil fields when South Sudan became independent in 2011.

How did protests evolve?

Initially, they focused on rising costs but quickly widened into demands for the removal of President Bashir, in charge for nearly 30 years, and his government.

The protests reached a climax on the symbolic date of 6 April - the anniversary of a 1985 non-violent uprising that removed then dictator Jaafar Nimeiri.

Reuters

Protesters adopted slogans of regime change that echoed the Arab Spring of 2011.

They gathered outside the headquarters of the military in the capital and refused to move.

Who are the protesters?

The economic problems brought Sudanese from all walks of life on to the streets but the organisation of demonstrations was taken on by the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), a collaboration of doctors, health workers and lawyers.

The proportion of women among the protesters has been put as high as 70% and they come from all ages and backgrounds. They say they are also demonstrating against Sudan's sexist attitudes in a conservative Muslim society where Sharia law is practised.

Video of a woman dubbed "Kandaka" (Nubian queen) leading chants was shared hundreds of thousands of times on Twitter.

The protesters are mostly young, reflecting the country's demographics, but people of all ages have been seen in the crowds.

At one point some individual soldiers were seen protecting those in the demonstrations but there was no mass transfer of allegiance.

Are they happy with the military government?

In a word, no.

In the immediate aftermath of the announcement that President Bashir had been replaced by a military council the SPA called on people to maintain the sit-in outside the military HQ.

This was in defiance of a curfew.

The SPA said the coup was led by a handful of military officials who were close to the former president and implicated in the problems that people were demonstrating about.

Who has been in control since the coup?

When he announced the "uprooting of the regime" on Thursday, Lt Gen Awad Ibn Auf said there would be a three-month state of emergency and a two-year transition period to prepare for civilian rule.

He appeared to side with the protesters saying: "For a long time, examining what's going on in the state and the corruption... the poor are poorer and the rich are still rich, and there are no equal chances for the same people."

On Friday, in the face of continued protests, Mr Ibn Auf himself stood down, as did the feared security chief, Gen Salah Gosh.

Lt Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan was then named as head of the transitional military council, to become Sudan's third leader in as many days.

According to the foreign ministry, Gen Burhan is "committed to having a complete civilian government".

What will happen to the former president?

The military council has said that Mr Bashir is in custody. He has not been seen in public since the coup and his whereabouts are unknown.

He is wanted for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court in connection with the conflict in Sudan's Darfur province.

The conflict in Sudan has turned into the largest displacement crisis worldwide. Widespread sexual violence is reported by many women and children who have sought safety in neighboring Chad. DW spoke with rape survivors.

Halima (name changed) has lived in various camps for displaced people for as long as she can remember. Every time she thought she had found safety, another attack happened, displacing her over and over.

She told DW that the memories of being upended so frequently keep her up at night.

In June 2023, fighters belonging to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) attacked the area of El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur, where she lived with her family.

Halima heard the militants arrive on their motorbikes. "They found me in my room," she said. "Four of them threatened me with guns. One choked my neck and raped me."

She suffered multiple wounds but eventually managed to escape, crossing the border into Chad. She felt safe there — but could not find the medical help she needed so badly after her ordeal.

Many women and children in camps in Chad have spoken of the issue, as reports of sexual violence within camps have also been on the rise.

Gender-based violence along ethnic lines

The majority of people who have fled across the border from war-torn Sudan are now in camps in eastern Chad — in places such as Adre.

Halima is one of them. She believes that the RSF militia mainly raped her because she belongs to the Massalit ethic group; the Massalit were the majority population in the city of El Geneina — until the RSF brutally attacked its citizens last year.

Another young woman at the camp, Hadija (name changed), corroborates Halima's impression.

She remembers how her attacker asked about the tribe she belonged to. "I did not tell him I was Massalit," she told DW. "I said I belong to the Fur tribe."

He threatened to kill her if she was Massalit, adding that the Massalit would never own any land in Sudan in future.

Hawa (name changed) survived a similar attack in June 2023.

She told DW that an RSF fighter entered her home and shot her 20-year-old cousin. Then she heard how her mother and aunt were being beaten.

"He beat me, too, with a whip, a stick, a water container," she said. "He then threw me on the bed and raped me."

It was only days later that she was able to finally find a hospital; she needed stitches after the attack and still feels pain when she walks.

These survivors' stories are backed up by Human Rights Watch, which has documented numerous atrocities of a similar nature, warning of a potential genocide unfolding against the Massalit people in West Darfur.

The RSF did not respond to DW's requests for comment.

The world's largest displacement crisis

In a report on gender-based violence published at the end of 2023, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reported that women and girls in Sudan had to bear the brunt of the consequences of the conflict there, including an "alarming" rise in levels of sexual violence.

Many of those seeking asylum elsewhere say they have experienced or witnessed harassment, abduction, rape, sexual assault, sexual exploitation and other forms of violence during their journeys to safety.

For over a year, the Sudanese Armed Forces have been fighting the RSF in a brutal battle for control of the country.

The conflict has forced millions of people to flee their homes since April 2023, pushing the number of displaced people to about 12 million by June 2024.

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) reports that more than 2 million people have sought refuge in neighboring countries since the eruption of the conflict. But the vast majority of them — over 10 million people — remain within Sudan, representing the largest displacement crisis in the world.

Aid organizations highlight that there are massive funding shortages to address the unfolding situation in Sudan and throughout the region.

Increased rates of rape

Abdirahman Ali, the country director for Sudan at CARE International, has confirmed this fast increasing rate of gender-based violence reported across Sudan, particularly in the areas that are currently witnessing the most violence, such as Darfur, Khartoum, Al Jazirah State and other areas.

Ali told DW that, especially in refugee camps, the violence against women and girls continues, adding that the situation is only being exacerbated by difficulties in the delivery of emergency food assistance, clean water, health care and nutrition.

The biggest challenge, he said, is moving health and nutrition supplies across the border from Chad into Sudan for people who are internally displaced.

"There are many areas [where] we are unable to access or even provide assistance due to the ongoing conflict and restrictions that will not allow us as aid workers to reach the people in need," he said.

According to the IRC, 90% of the people crossing borders in the region in search of safety are women and children. One in five young children are experiencing acute malnutrition.

Psychological support for people affected by gender-based violence is also hard to come by, Ali said: "There are multiple displacements. Communities and internationally displaced persons are moving from one location to the other, complicating [efforts] to provide continuous support to this population."

Escape to Chad — and beyond

Before the conflict began, Sudan was already experiencing a severe humanitarian crisis caused by long-term political instability and economic pressures in the country.

The war has only added to these conditions, leaving almost 25 million people — more than half of Sudan's population — in need, according to the IRC.

More than 600,000 people have crossed the border into Chad, which had already been hosting 400,000 Sudanese refugees prior to the outbreak of conflict.

This is why the IRC has also expanded critical services to support Sudanese refugees in neighboring countries beyond Chad, including Uganda, Ethiopia and South Sudan.

Human rights obligations ignored

Ali demands that the parties involved in the conflict uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilian populations and infrastructure.

In order for the human rights situation to improve, he said, the aid workers providing assistance would also need to be granted safeguards.

"There is a need for the parties of conflict to go to the negotiation table and ensure that this crisis is brought to a halt," he said. "It is causing untold human suffering to the people of Sudan."

Despite the trauma, Hawa and Halima both hope to return to their previous lives; Hawa dreams of completing her studies in economics to work "as an accountant or as a business administrator."

Halima also wants to get her old life back. "If the situation improves, I want to go to university," she said. "I'm a midwife — but I want to become a doctor."

Shelling at busy Sudanese market 'fills mortuary with bodies'

36 minutes ago Wedaeli Chibelushi BBC News

Getty Images Fighting in Omdurman has intensified in recent weeks

Shelling at a busy market near Sudan's capital has filled a mortuary with bodies, medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) says. MSF and the Sudanese authorities said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were responsible for Saturday's attack in the city of Omdurman, which killed and injured more than 100 people - a claim the RSF has denied. The majority of those killed at the market were women and children, the Sudanese Doctors' Union says. The RSF and Sudan's army have been locked in a civil war that, over 22 months, has killed tens of thousands and sparked what the UN describes as one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters.

In the past few weeks, the army has stepped up its offensive in Omdurman, which lies across the River Nile from capital city, Khartoum, aiming to regain complete control from the RSF. Eyewitnesses told the AFP news agency that Saturday's artillery shelling had come from western Omdurman, where the RSF remains in control. Saturday's explosion caused "utter carnage" at the nearby Al Nao hospital, which was overwhelmed with injured patients, MSF general secretary Chris Lockyear said. The Sudanese Doctors' Union appealed for nearby medics to assist at the hospital, saying there was an "acute shortage of medical staff". It added that one shell had fallen "metres away" from the hospital on Saturday. One survivor of the market attack told the AFP news agency: "The shells hit in the middle of the vegetable market, that's why the victims and the wounded are so many." Both sides have been accused of targeting civilians, including health workers, and indiscriminate shelling of residential areas. The recent skirmishes have forced emergency response rooms to shut several health centres, affecting the provision of medical services to thousands of residents.

Omar al-Bashir ousted: How Sudan got here

11 April 2019 Share Save Share Save

EPA Protesters celebrate amid rumours over President Omar al-Bashir's fate

Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has been ousted and arrested following months of protests, the army has announced.

It is a momentous move - Mr Bashir had been in power for nearly 30 years and was a severe and uncompromising ruler.

The BBC looks at five significant moments that explain how we got here.

30 June 1989: General Bashir comes to power

AFP

Mr Bashir seized power in a military coup in 1989, amid a long civil war between Sudan's north and south.

During his time in power, he was accused of war crimes during the Darfur conflict, which began in 2003 when rebels took up arms at alleged government discrimination. Hundreds of thousands were killed in the crisis.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) indicted Mr Bashir on charges of crimes against humanity and genocide - although the investigation was eventually suspended due to a lack of UN support.

However, Mr Bashir went on to win his first term as an elected president in polls in 2010.

9 July 2011: South Sudan becomes independent

AFP 99% of South Sudan voted for independence

In 2011, following a referendum, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan. The referendum had been part of a peace deal agreed between Mr Bashir and rebels from the south.

However, the split had significant financial repercussions, because South Sudan gained 75% of the territory's oil.

Sudan's economy - which had already been strained by more than a decade of US sanctions - was hit hard.

The government imposed austerity measures and cut subsidies in response to the drop in oil revenue - but this lead to waves of protests as prices for basic goods shot up.

The government responded by dispersing protesters, arresting opposition politicians, and censoring the media.

Meanwhile, Mr Bashir was re-elected in 2015 in a vote boycotted by the opposition.

19 December 2018: Anti-austerity protests

In late 2017, the US lifted some sanctions on Sudan. However, the economy continued to deteriorate - by November 2018, inflation was at almost 70%.

As the Sudanese pound plummeted in value, the government imposed emergency austerity measures and cut fuel and bread subsidies.

This triggered waves of mass protests across the country in December. The protests were initially focused on living costs - but soon demonstrators also started demanding that Mr Bashir step down.

More than 1,000 protesters were reportedly detained by government forces.

22 February 2019: State of emergency

In February, Sudan's National Security and Intelligence Services said that Mr Bashir would step down.

However, Mr Bashir was defiant, declaring a national state of emergency, dismissing the federal government and replacing all state governors with members of the security forces instead.

He also tried to placate protesters, saying he would stand down at the end of his term in April 2020 and not seek re-election. However, this was not enough for demonstrators - and critics argued he had previously pledged to step down and then gone back on his word.

6 April 2019: Protesters close in on the army headquarters

Thousands of demonstrators reached the military headquarters - which is near the presidential compound - for the first time.

A woman dubbed 'Kandaka', which means Nubian queen, has become a symbol for protesters

Thousands camped outside throughout the week - and while security forces used tear gas and made arrests, the police ordered officers not to "intervene against the citizens or peaceful rallies".

The police said they supported the "peaceful transition of power".

According to analysts, the military and security forces were also divided on how to respond, with reports that army officers wanted to avoid violence, while security chiefs and some paramilitary groups were ready to use lethal force.

As the Sudan conflict between the army and the Rapid Support Forces reaches the one-year mark, over 25 million people face a humanitarian crisis with no end in sight.

Fighting in Sudan between the army and paramilitaries has been ongoing for almost one year.

Two generals, Abdel Fattah Burhan and Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, are fighting for control over Africa's third-largest country and its vast resources.

Burhan leads the Sudanese Armed Forces, while Dagalo, better known as Hemedti, controls the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group.

The bloody conflict has killed thousands and sparked a humanitarian disaster. According to the United Nations, around 25 million people — more than half the population — need aid, and nearly 18 million face acute food insecurity.

The two primary warring factions have now launched attacks in and around civilian areas.

The US special envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, wrote on the social media platform X that "the Sudanese army's bombing raids in El Fasher, where thousands of civilians from across Darfur have sought refuge, have failed to avoid civilian locations, resulting in dozens of casualties."

He added that the RSF's attacks on villages in the state of El Gezira had also led to civilian deaths and the displacement of thousands.

In another message on X, Perriello said that "reports of growing famine and attacks on civilians must be heard as a call to action for all of us, as this war nears its tragic first anniversary."

Sudan's grim year of devastation

Since fighting erupted on April 15, 2023, more than 8.5 million people have been displaced, many of whom have sought refuge in neighboring Chad and South Sudan.

Thousands have fled to the border town of Renk in South Sudan. Conditions there are grim, with camps severely overcrowded due to the high influx of refugees each day.

Sanitation is woefully insufficient, with, for example, up to 200 people sharing one latrine. There has been a rise in cholera and measles, as well as an increase in cases of severe malnutrition.

Aid agencies have said they are struggling to meet the needs of exhausted and traumatized families, many of whom have walked for days with little food and water.

Khalida Ibrahim Salateen, who was displaced from Sudan's capital, Khartoum, described the situation as dire. "We sleep on the ground. There's no food. There's water, but it's not clean, and children get sick with no nearby hospital. The situation is very difficult," she told DW.

Despair amid prayers

Fatim Douka, originally from El Gezira, is now living in a sprawling camp in Renk. She told DW that this year, the Islamic holy month of Ramadan had been full of despair, hopelessness, and unyielding prayers.

"We're struggling in this camp as we cannot find anything to eat," she said. "Many people who are fasting can't even find anything to break their fast. They have only been drinking water since Ramadan started. Even the medications provided to us are only for general purposes, like paracetamol. However, medications for hypertension and diabetes are unavailable."

Madina Zakaria Hamdallah, who was displaced from Khartoum, has experienced a similar ordeal. "It's Ramadan, and we need to receive aid," she said. "Children are hungry, but there's no food, water, or clothes for them. We don't get it. They keep telling us that an NGO is coming to help, but no one has arrived."

UN warns of widespread death due to hunger

The long and desperate wait for food aid could continue.

Perriello has accused both the military and the Rapid Support Forces of obstructing humanitarian assistance and the free movement of civilians across the country.

This comes as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification initiative, backed by the United Nations, has warned that immediate action is needed to "prevent widespread death and total collapse of livelihoods and avert a catastrophic hunger crisis in Sudan."

Regarded as a global authority on food security, the UN initiative was due to issue an update to its December analysis, which found nearly 5 million people on the verge of catastrophic hunger. However, due to the ongoing war, it was unable to do so.

As the refugee crisis worsens, the international community is facing mounting moral pressure for urgent action.

"It is all about saving lives ... asking for resources, for sustainability," said Mamadou Dian Balde, a regional director with the UN refugee agency UNHCR.

'Why Sudan is shooting medics'

18 January 2019 Share Save Share Save

Reuters Some protesters wear masks as protection from tear gas

Doctors in Sudan are emerging as a leading force in a wave of anti-government protests, but they are paying a price for their defiance.

On Thursday, witnesses say a doctor was killed by the security forces amid demonstrations in the capital, Khartoum.

The protests began last month over the economic situation in the country but are now focused on removing long-time President Omar al-Bashir from office.

One medic, who requested anonymity, told the BBC's Newsday programme about the killing of his colleague and how doctors feel they have now become a target for the authorities:

It was a very sad day for us in Sudan, especially for doctors. A doctor was killed while he was trying to perform his duty. He was helping those injured in Buri, which is an area just near the Royal Care Hospital in the centre of Khartoum.

The witnesses that came with the doctor to the hospital told me what happened.

The doctor was trapped with some of the protesters inside a house in Buri. He was trying to provide medical care for them and the police forces tried to force them out of the house so they fired tear gas inside the house.

They couldn't stay inside anymore. So the doctor took a very brave stand.

He opened the door and he kept his hands held up high, trying to show them that he was coming out peacefully and he asked them if he could approach them just to talk to them.

Sudan protests: People flee gunshots in deadly protest

Surprisingly they agreed and they said, "OK you can keep approaching us, we're ready to talk to you."

When he came close, he started explaining that he was a medical doctor and he was trying to provide medical care for the injured inside, that five people were injured and he was the only doctor in the house.

The response he got was: "You are a medical doctor, well we are looking for you." And they took two steps back and they just fired at him.

They killed him with such brutality. They just didn't care. They just shot him and then went away.

It's a very sad situation.

We, as medical doctors, feel that our lives are in danger every day.

On Thursday, our small community of doctors told us that whenever we are on the street, whenever we are helping people, and even if we are doing our daily activities, we should never mention to any police officers or national security members or that we are medical doctors because they are trying to eradicate any medical doctor.

They are focusing on us because the medical doctors are now leading nationwide strikes. The people started the protests, but when the police became violent the doctors rose up to lead the protests.

Doctors under attack:

A doctor was shot dead after witnesses said he identified himself to security services as a medic on Thursday

Security forces have attacked hospitals with tear gas and live ammunition, says the Sudan Doctors' Syndicate (SDS)

A general manager of Tuga private hospital was arrested in Khartoum earlier this month after saying they would treat protesters free of charge.

This is in addition to at least 11 other doctors the SDS list as arrested, including its leaders

Medical student Hassan Omer was left quadriplegic after being shot through the neck on 25 December during a protest, reports the British Medical Journal

Dr Alaa Nugdallah, the head of the Sudanese Surgeons' Association, was arrested on 14 January at his office in Khartoum. The association had issued a statement on 13 January warning of a nationwide strike if detained doctors were not released in 24 hours, reports Human Rights Watch

Surgical registrar Sabir Mohamed Ahmed was shot through the thigh during a protest on 25 December.

In the Sudanese community doctors are well respected because they tend to be people who were recognised as being intelligent and given education.

Now we are trying to persuade people to protest through civil disobedience - so to stay at home, don't go to work, don't go anywhere.

We've become a threat to the government.

We know that there are threats but there is still a lot we can do as doctors. We're very determined to keep doing our jobs.

Reuters Demonstrators hit the streets again on Friday

I really believe that there is no turning back from what's happening in Sudan.

We've seen people die, we've seen people in their twenties sustain permanent disabilities and still insisting that freedom is more important than life lived in fear.

Sudan coup leader Awad Ibn Auf steps down

AFP Mr Ibn Auf quit a day after becoming military council chief

The head of Sudan's military council has stood down a day after leading a coup that toppled long-time leader Omar al-Bashir amid a wave of protests.

Defence Minister Awad Ibn Auf announced his decision on state TV, naming as his successor Lt-Gen Abdel Fattah Abdelrahman Burhan.

The army has said it will stay in power for two years, followed by elections.

But protest leaders say they will not leave the streets until the military hands over to a civilian government.

Mr Bashir's downfall followed months of unrest that began in December over rising prices.

Mr Ibn Auf was head of military intelligence during the Darfur conflict in the 2000s. The US imposed sanctions on him in 2007.

The new man in charge is also a top military figure, but the Associated Press news agency reports that his record is cleaner than other Sudanese generals. He is also said to have met with protesters to hear their views.

AFP Lt-Gen Burhan could be seen talking to demonstrators on Friday

Mr Bashir has been indicted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the Darfur conflict.

However, the military council has said it will not extradite Mr Bashir, who denies the charges, although he may be put on trial in Sudan.

How did the latest drama unfold?

Despite Mr Bashir's removal on Thursday, demonstrators had refused to disperse, camping out outside army headquarters in the capital, Khartoum, in defiance of a curfew.

Reuters Demonstrators stayed out on the streets of Khartoum overnight

In its first response, the military council came out and denied it was seeking power, telling the protesters that they would decide the country's future, while the army maintained public order.

A few hours later, Mr Ibn Auf announced he was resigning and would be replaced by Lt-Gen Burhan.

"In order to ensure the cohesion of the security system, and the armed forces in particular, from cracks and strife, and relying on God, let us begin this path of change," he said.

Protesters celebrated his abrupt departure but the Sudan Professionals Association, which has been spearheading the demonstrations, later announced that the sit-in would continue.

Sudanese women reject 'regime coup'

"We call on the armed forces to ensure the immediate transfer of power to a transitional civilian government," they said on Facebook.

They further called for the abolition of "arbitrary decisions by leaders that do not represent the people" and the detention of "all symbols of the former regime who were involved in crimes against the people".

"Until these demands are fully met, we must continue with our sit-in at the General Command of the Armed Forces," the SPA said.

Meanwhile, police said at least 16 people had been killed by stray bullets at the protests on Thursday and Friday.

A precarious moment full of possibility

Awad Ibn Ouf has stepped down to be replaced by a general the senior military hope will be more acceptable to the protesters. The momentum is with civil society.

The regime has floundered since this phase of protests began. The old ways of coercion haven't worked and they face a civil society that is well organised and disciplined. This is a further retreat. It is unlikely to be the last.

And there's the economic crisis brought about by misrule, corruption and loss of oil revenues. Even the regime's friends in the Middle East and Asia will think twice about rescue packages if it looks like a new version of the old venality and brutality. That's an important pressure.

This is an exciting moment. Just think about the role of women in all of this, of social media and civil society. It's happening in Sudan but the significance of these forces working peacefully for change is universal. Yes it's very precarious, but also full of possibility.

Sudan army makes huge gains as it seeks to recapture war-torn capital

10 hours ago Mohanad Hashim & Natasha Booty BBC News

AFP Many hope an end to the civil war is in sight

Residents of Sudan's capital Khartoum say the army has recaptured large parts of the city from RSF paramilitaries, marking its biggest victory in a year. "Shrapnel and stray ammunition are falling on my neighbourhood," a doctor we are calling Mustafa tells the BBC. "The clashes these days are heavy". Key sites recaptured by the army this week include the mint – where money is printed. At the time of writing, the RSF still controls most of Khartoum proper. Whereas the army now holds the majority of territory across the wider tripartite capital - meaning Omdurman, Bahri and Khartoum.

The army has been jubilantly welcomed by many inhabitants of the areas it has recently recaptured, as the RSF has been widely accused of killing and raping civilians in Khartoum, as well as looting the homes of the many residents who have fled the city. Reports of the army's advance have been dismissed by the RSF as "lies and rumours". They have made similar denials ahead of every retreat in recent weeks. Analysts say the army's recent successes have been the result of enlisting more fighters and buying more weaponry. Winning back the besieged army headquarters was also a huge boon earlier this month. The army's expulsion of the paramilitary group from the central city of Wad Madani in January was marred by allegations of summary executions and arbitrary retribution attacks on those perceived to be RSF informants or collaborators. This will no doubt raise fears among some Khartoum residents that the same fate awaits them. "When you open social media and you see all the killing, if you've committed something wrong you must be worried," Mustafa told the BBC. "Some of them led fighters to people's homes. Others joined [the RSF] and stole property, terrorised people - even held women against their will [as sex slaves]. They did horrible things. "Are they terrified of what is to come? Of course." But sometimes there is a fine line between being seen as a collaborator, and the reality of survival in war. "I am worried for my cousin," says Amir, who lives in Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman, which lies just across the River Nile. "He is not a collaborator or an informant - he often has to deal with these people [the RSF] because he's looking after his mother and his kids. Will he be slaughtered [by the army] or will he be left alone?" For now, as the army approaches and Sudan's future hands in the balance, all that Mustafa and Amir can do is wait. Some names have been changed in this report for reasons of safety

Letter from Africa: 'We're not cleaners' - sexism amid Sudan protests

31 March 2019 Share Save Share Save

AFP

In our series of letters from African journalists, Zeinab Mohammed Salih considers why female protesters are angry with their male counterparts.

The anti-government protests in Sudan are unwavering despite a state of emergency imposed in February.

This is largely thanks to the efforts of the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which has been organising the demonstrations against President Omar al-Bashir's nearly 30-year rule.

The body represents health workers, lawyers and teachers, amongst others - though some would argue, not women - even though it is estimated that more than 70% of the protesters who have been out on the streets since December are female.

The SPA got itself into hot water when it suggested that instead of a day of scheduled protests on Saturday 9 March, people come out instead to clean the streets.

The streets of the capital, Khartoum, are particularly mucky - and it was felt that a good tidy up would restore a sense of pride in the city.

Since the protests began, the SPA has been particularly praised for the beautiful language used in its statements calling for action.

However, in this instance it struck the wrong tone - urging women in particular to come out for the task because they "cared more about cleaning".

The message was met with outrage by many female protesters - and sparked a debate on social media about the sexism of the uprising.

A day later, the SPA, which has female spokesperson, issued a contrite apology.

These protests began in reaction to a hike in bread prices - and then mushroomed into the most serious challenge to Mr Bashir's hold on power since an Islamist-backed coup in 1989.

'We are not queens'

Likewise, the street-cleaning faux pas began as anger about the sexist attitudes of male protesters and has mushroomed into anger about how women are treated in Sudanese society.

On social media, comments such as "even women have protested" have been a particular point of contention.

Protesting women are not a new phenomenon in Sudan. In 1946, 10 years before independence, the country's first female doctor, Khalida Zahir, took to the streets against British rule and was arrested and flogged.

Getty Images Schoolgirls have also taken to the street in the anti-government protests

Another sore point is the recent use of the word "Kandaka" to describe a female protester.

Kandaka was the word used to refers to queens in the ancient Kush kingdom that ruled Sudan thousands of years ago.

The literal translation from Arabic of the controversial SPA statement read: "When is the cleaning day? On Saturday Kandaka - yes we mean you, because you care more about it."

The dislike for the term hinges on the fact that female protesters don't see themselves as above others - they are the people, taking the same risks as everyone else.

The irony of the word also angers others as they say there is no gender equality in the mainly Muslim country where female genital mutilation is still practised - almost 90% of Sudanese women have been cut.

You may also be interested in:

Women from all backgrounds and ages have been protesting - some on the frontline, others standing in front of their houses sheltering those who flee live ammunition or tear gas.

They have also been serving protesters with food and drinks.

'The time has come'

Images have also been circulating on social media of prominent men who support the government and have criticised the demonstrations, mocking them by feminising their faces on Photoshop. The implication is that they are cowards.

This has led a group of feminists to launch a campaign called "Waqto wa naso", meaning "The time has come", calling for such sexist attitudes to be denounced.

According to the No To Women Oppression group, between 40,000 and 50,000 women are arrested and flogged each year by the police for flouting the country's Public Order Act introduced by Mr Bashir's government.

The law regulates what women can wear - they can, for example, be flogged for wearing clothes such as trousers that are considered indecent or simply for being out with men who are not their relatives.

Sudan's Public Order laws

Article 152 of the Criminal Code applies to "indecent acts" in public

This can include wearing an "obscene outfit" or "causing an annoyance to public feelings"

Women must wear a headscarf and cannot wear trousers

Between 40,000 and 50,000 women are arrested and flogged every year by public order police because of their clothing

Women have also been charged under this law for being alone with a man

People can also be charged for drinking alcohol under these laws

Interestingly, earlier this month a court overturned flogging sentences for nine women accused of taking part in protests.

And the clean-up day in Khartoum did take place - with both men and women taking part.

These could perhaps be seen as signs of changing times for women in Sudan.

With both sides of the war sanctioned and key strategic points falling back to the Sudanese Armed Forces, observers see Darfur coming up as the last major battleground. Is peace in sight?

The most recent advances by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan's capital Khartoum and the nearby city of Omdurman indicate a change to the bitter and bloody stalemate that has dominated the past months of the Sudanese war.

Last week, General Abdel-Fattah Burhan, who heads the SAF, returned to headquarters in Khartoum for the first time in almost two years. Earlier in January, the SAF had managed to recapture the strategically important city of Wad Madani, which is around 180 kilometers (110 miles) south of Khartoum.

"When Wad Madani fell to the Rapid Support Forces in December 2023, a shock went through the entire country," Hager Ali, a researcher at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, told DW.

"The Sudanese lost confidence in the Sudanese Armed Forces' ability, which is why Wad Madani is seared into the peoples' memories as a watershed moment," she added.

The RSF had burned crops, razed fields and destroyed farming equipment.

"They weaponized hunger against the people of Sudan in order to establish control," Ali explained, adding that "this was the moment when food insecurity not only became worse by a hundred-fold, it also became something that nobody is going to be able to remedy for the foreseeable future."

Owing to the loss of vital infrastructure in the central city, "the tactical and strategic significance that Wad Madani had a year ago as Sudan's breadbasket is almost gone," so the expert.

The strategic significance of Wad Madani as Sudan's breadbasket has been demolished by the Rapid Support Forces' scorched earth tactics. Image: AFP

Darfur as the next and last battle?

Since the RFS' loss of Wad Madani, many of its paramilitary fighters have retreated to Sudan's western Darfur region, where the RSF control four out of five districts.

"The countdown for an end of the war has begun, the field of war has moved to El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur," Osman Mirghani, the editor-in-chief of the Sudanese newspaper Al-Tayar, told DW's radio show Sudan Now .

El Fasher has been under a siege by the RSF since May 2024.

According to UN estimates, the humanitarian situation in Darfur has become particularly dire. Some 1.6 million people are displaced from North Darfur alone, around two million people are facing extreme food insecurity, while 320,000 are already in famine conditions.

Sudanese civilians across the country have been bearing the brunt of the conflict, which broke out in April 2023 when General Abdel-Fattah Burhan fell out with his former deputy General Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo over the integration of the paramilitary RSF into the regular army.

Clashes between both forces and their allies killed tens of thousands of civilians and displaced more than 12 million. Over 30 million Sudanese, over half of them children, are in need of humanitarian aid.

According to the US-based global relief organization International Rescue Committee, Sudan's war has triggered the "largest humanitarian crisis ever recorded."

This week, Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights warned that the "senseless war" has taken an "even more dangerous turn for civilians." The comment came on the heels of an incident last weekend, when the paramilitary RSF killed at least 54 civilians and injured more than 160 at a market in Omdurman. A few days earlier, at least 70 people had been killed in an RSF attack on a hospital in El Fasher.

As of now, the RSF has denied any wrongdoing and instead accused the Sudanese army and its allies of striking the hospital.

The United Nations Human Rights Office also stated that it was investigating "disturbing video footage that surfaced on 30 January, in which men in SAF uniforms (…) appear to read out a list of alleged RSF collaborators," as if to indicate they were keeping a ledger of individuals killed.

While the allegations in the video are still being examined, Turk has warned that "such killings must not become normalized."

Sanctions and war crimes

Meanwhile, after almost two years of warnings, one of the last acts by the outgoing US administration under Joe Biden was to impose sanctions on both generals.

The RSF under General Mohammed Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, was accused of committing genocide, as well as grave human rights violations.

The SAF under General Abdel-Fattah Burhan was accused of committing lethal attacks against civilians and of undermining the goal of a democratic transition.

"These sanctions represent the most significant international intervention to date," Leena Badri, a researcher at the London-based think tank Chatham House, wrote earlier this month in an op-ed.

"For the RSF, the sanctions and subsequent genocide determination will surely thwart Hemedti's plan to develop a civilian administration in his strongholds," she argued.

"Burhan has benefited from his position as the de facto leader of Sudan (…) but with US sanctions imposed on both him and Hemedti, his status will appear reduced," she added.

Trump as peacemaker?

As part of Biden's sanctions, the US treasury department also blacklisted seven companies from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and accused them of funnelling arms, finances and support to the RSF.

However, the UAE have been denying being the key supporter for the RSF even though evidence in the form of UAE-produced arms indicate the opposite. The SAF is publicly supported by Egypt and Qatar.

It is still unclear in what ways US President Donald Trump would continue US policy on Sudan during his second term.

During his first term, Trump had delisted Sudan from the US list of terror organizations. He had also brokered a normalization agreement between Sudan and Israel in return for economic relief. The series of agreements, dubbed as Abraham Accords, between Arab states and Israel also included the United Arab Emirates, Morocco and Bahrain.

However, Badri is not too hopeful that US pressure alone could push the warring generals toward an end of the war.

"President Trump has repeatedly shown a willingness to antagonize even America's closest allies in pursuit of his own goals," she told DW.

"As a result, sanctions targeting both warring parties remain largely symbolic without a concerted push — particularly aimed at US partners in the Middle East — to shut down the networks fuelling the conflict," she said.

"At present, both generals are more focused on securing further military gains as their sources of arms, funds, and backing remain unaffected," Badri told DW, adding that "they have little incentive to bend to sanctions alone."

For the Sudanese population, hope now lies on a stop of armed supply before they mark the outbreak of the war for the second time in April.

Violence in Sudan is escalating, with millions of people facing displacement and hundreds killed and injured. But the warring parties and their allies have little interest in peace.

"Time is running out for millions of people in Sudan who are at imminent risk of famine," the United Nations (UN) and humanitarian organizations warned this week in a joint statement.

"Despite the tremendous needs, aid workers continue to face systematic obstructions and deliberate denials of access by parties to the conflict."

For over a year, the country has been torn apart by two warring parties .

A few days ago, Alice Nderitu, UN special adviser on the prevention of genocide, issued a statement warning that the situation in Sudan bore "all the marks of risk of genocide."

"Civilians are being attacked and killed because of the color of their skin, because of their ethnicity, because of who they are," she said.

On Thursday, the Madani Resistance Committee reported an attack by the Rapid Support Forces, RSF, on the village Wad al-Noura in the central Gezira state. More than 100 people were killed, and many more dispersed, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) -aligned committee said. Footage on social media shows scores of bodies wrapped in white shrouds.

The RSF confirmed the attack, however not the number of killed civilians.

According to Doctors Without Borders , at least 145 people have been killed and more than 700 injured since May 10. "We see a bloodbath unfolding before our own eyes in El Fasher," said Claire Nicolet, the organization's emergencies manager for Sudan.

Aid organizations say they are barely able to work due to the violence.

Crisis in El Fasher

The situation in El Fasher, the capital of the state of North Darfur, is particularly critical. More than 1 million people from across Sudan have found refuge in the city, which is under the control of the SAF, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. It has been besieged and repeatedly attacked by the rival RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is better known as Hemeti.

"Famine is imminent in El Fasher," Marina Peter, the chairwoman of the German non-profit Sudan and South Sudan Forum, told DW, explaining that another mass displacement would be triggered if the RSF were to take the city.

She said that would also probably lead to a dramatic increase in food prices, as has been seen in other places taken by the RSF. "Those who have money would be lucky enough to be able to leave the city, but the poor would be downright slaughtered," she told DW.

Fragile ties

Peter said that she believed the RSF was being so brutal in order to persuade people to join its ranks. "El Fasher is basically just the missing piece. If it succeeds, Sudan will split in two, which would be a political disaster"

Another reason for the brutality is that the warring parties are pressed for time. The longer the war lasts, the more likely the alliances will crumble. According to an analysis by the International Crisis Group (ICG), an independent organization that works to prevent wars and shape policies to build a more peaceful world, the two sides have been relying on alliances with local militias, which are difficult to control. "The conflict has entered a perilous new phase, with Sudan slipping deeper into disintegration," the ICG said in a statement .

International actors

The warring parties are also relying more heavily on alliances with international actors.

Last fall, the SAF's commander, al-Burhan, made diplomatic overtures to Iran and has since had combat drones at its disposal. He also apparently has support from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who would like to see "someone like him at the helm of a firmly managed state," said Peter.

Egypt and Sudan are also tied to each other for political and ideological reasons, said Hager Ali, a political analyst at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, who recently published an analysis of the war in Sudan. She told DW that al-Burhan's policies and the conservative character of the Egyptian government shared similarities. "Egypt will not work with the (rival) RSF simply because it is not a state actor," she explained.

In view of this situation, RSF leader Hemeti is presenting himself more and more as a freedom fighter. Thus, he has gained the support of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Russia is also at least indirectly on his side, as Hemeti gave the Wagner Group, now known on the African continent as the Africa Corps, the mining rights to Sudan's enormous gold deposits.

"Both the UAE and Russia are keen to expand their influence in Africa," Ali told DW, adding that "both states share a common interest in Sudan's gold deposits."

Moreover, she said, Sudan was an important key to both countries gaining a foothold in Africa. "This is being done both through cooperation with non-state actors such as Hemeti, which are beyond state control, and with state actors, so as to cover the official channels."

According to the AP news agency, Russia eventually plans to build a logistics center in Port Sudan and expand it into a naval base. Russian envoys reportedly met with the head of the SAF at the end of April to discuss the plans despite their alliance with the RSF. Russia will apparently provide Sudan with weapons and military equipment.

'Controlled instability'

Overall, the international actors are not very likely to be interested in resolving the conflict. "For all states involved, Sudan is the gateway to the Red Sea and then to Africa via the Red Sea," said Ali.

It suited them that there were hardly any functioning institutions left in Sudan. This made it easier to establish a military base or a diplomatic presence without red tape. "It all happens much faster through unofficial, opaque channels for smuggling weapons, as is currently the case in Sudan," she said.

"In this respect, the actors have less interest in peace in the long term than in controlled instability."

Why the end of US sanctions hasn't helped Sudan

10 July 2018 Share Save Share Save

Getty Images Many people in Sudan are feeling the financial pinch

Sudanese hopes that the lifting of US sanctions will improve their economy have failed to materialise, writes the BBC's James Copnall from the capital Khartoum.

When the US decided to remove economic sanctions on Sudan last October, President Omar al-Bashir's government was ecstatic.

Not only did this signal a new era in the often tempestuous relationship with Washington, it allowed the politicians - and the Sudanese people - to hope that an end to a severe economic crisis was in sight.

But instead of regaining its footing, the economy has fallen off a cliff, with inflation soaring and people struggling to get by.

Nahla Mohaka, a film-maker and writer, is part of Khartoum's middle class - and, like almost everyone, is feeling the financial pinch.

She serves a delicious lunch of fuul - a bean stew with onions - and taamiya - the Sudanese version of falafel.

"Normally there would be a meat dish, but meat had become very expensive. And even the fuul - before this would have been about 10 Sudanese pounds ($0.56; £0.42), now it is 50 or more," Ms Mohaka says.

Getty Images Families have cut down on eating fruit

A few years ago, there were fewer than four Sudanese pounds to the dollar - now it is 29 by the official rate, and over 40 on the black market.

Inflation is over 55%, the highest rate for around two decades.

Salaries, though, have not risen much - leading to widespread anger and frustration.

Ms Mohaka's family have cut down on fruit, and meat of course. Many poorer families are forced to cut out entire meals to make do.

And Ms Mohaka points out, it is often women who bear the brunt of this.

"They are the ones working, they are ones who look after the family, they are the ones cooking, so this is a very hard situation for them especially," she says.

Still blaming the US

The sanctions stopped any transactions using US currency or products. In practice this meant any business which operated in the US was not able to trade with Sudan.

For years, international banks would not operate in Sudan, and the state and companies were largely unable to get spare parts for things like aeroplanes or vital health equipment.

Although this has ended in theory, in practice little seems to have changed.

Sudanese officials blame the US - suggesting that Washington has not properly spread the word that there is no longer any risk involved in doing business in Sudan.

Others, though, feel that the Sudanese government used the sanctions to mask its own responsibility for the deteriorating living standards.

Hafiz Mohamed, from the rights group Justice Africa Sudan, says the government's actions in conflict zones in Darfur, South Kordofan and Blue Nile, and in the way it runs the state, are to blame for the economic crisis.

"We need to first of all stop all the conflicts, and cut the spending on security and the military," he says, sitting in the courtyard of his office.

"The government spends less than 10% of its budget on health and education. The economic problem is the manifestation of the political problem Sudan faces," he adds.

The link between politics and the economy is important in other ways, too.

"All states in the world, the United States included, have their own human rights problems"

In January, people took to the streets to protest about a removal in wheat subsidies, which led to a price rise.

In response, the government detained dozens of people, many of them for almost three months with no charge.

'Assaulted in prison'

Amjed Farid, a political activist, was one of them - in a jail the inmates nicknamed the fridge, because the air conditioning was permanently on.

"I saw many young people being beaten, many Darfuri and Nuba people are detained for a very long time.

"This needs to stop, and people need to be accountable for that. This is not protecting the national security of any country. This is a criminal offence against civilians."

Getty Images Sudan has been hit by conflict in Darfur

Concern over human rights in Sudan is not new - President Omar al-Bashir's government have been accused of a catalogue of abuses in the nearly three decades since he took power in a coup.

But the issue is likely to play a vital role in Sudan's latest attempt to improve its economic situation.

'Sponsor of terrorism'

The country's foreign policy over the last few years has been dominated by one thing: improving relations with the outside world to increase investment.

Overtures have been made to a dizzying array of countries, many of them fiercely opposed to each other: Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the European Union - the list goes on.

The attempts to broker peace in South Sudan - which resulted in a preliminary agreement between President Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Riek Machar in Khartoum last week - can be seen in this light.

Security in South Sudan benefits Sudan - particularly if the South Sudanese get their oil production up to the level it hit at the time of its independence in 2011.

Getty Images Many people can no longer afford to buy meat

The South Sudanese export their oil through Sudan's pipelines and export terminals, at a cost of around $25 per barrel - any increase in production is a huge boost to the treasuries of both countries.

But at the heart of Sudan's drive for better foreign relations is the link to America.

Now Sudan wants to get off the list of countries that the US lists as "sponsors of terrorism".

If it gets the designation removed, debt relief and international financial aid would be possible, bringing an end, perhaps, to the economic crisis.

To do so, the Sudanese will have to make progress on a number of areas - including human rights.

More on Sudan

Typically, Sudanese officials deny that any abuses take place.

So I was surprised when the foreign minister, Al Dirdiry Mohamed Ahmed, took a slightly different line.

"All states in the world, the United States included, have their own human rights problems. Sudan is having problems, like any other state, and we are working hard to resolve those problems."

His next sentence summed up Khartoum's change of approach as it tries to weather the economic storm.

"Definitely engagement with the international community will help us - rather than seclusion," he says.

Getty Images Diplomatic initiatives to end conflict in South Sudan have so far failed

The Sudanese government is not monolithic, and there are some who resist the need to change, not least because the feared security services and the narrow space allowed for opposition politicians and activists are reasons why this government has lasted so long.

And the authorities have another problem: President Bashir himself.

He is indicted by the International Criminal Court for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in Darfur. He denies the charges.

It is difficult to see how the president could step down, knowing that this could lead him to a trial at The Hague. Already it seems likely he will run again in the 2020 elections, despite previous promises that this would be his last term.

As long as he stays in power, it will be hard for Sudan to get off the list of "state sponsors of terror", and fully restore its relations with the US and others.

With prices rising by the day, and growing anger about it, this is a difficult time for the Sudanese government.

What next for Sudan and its 'master manipulator' Omar al-Bashir?

10 April 2019 Share Save Share Save

Getty Images Some army officers want to avoid violence and have supported protesters

Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir is the master of tactics, but the tidal wave of popular protest is beyond anything he has faced before, writes Sudan expert Alex de Waal.

Protests against the government of President Bashir reached a climax on the symbolic date of 6 April, which is the anniversary of a non-violent uprising that removed the dictator Jaafar Nimeiri in 1985.

They began in the northern town of Atbara on 19 December 2018, focused on high food prices, and quickly spread to other towns and cities across Sudan. The demonstrations changed from a narrowly economic agenda to demanding that President Bashir, who took power in a coup in June 1989, step down.

The protests have continued for close to four months, gaining in numbers and organisation, almost entirely non-violent. According to who is counting, between 45 and 60 people have been killed by government forces firing on the demonstrators, and hundreds have been arrested - some of them tortured.

Omar al-Bashir at a glance:

AFP

Fights in Egyptian army in 1973 Arab-Israeli war

Seizes power in Sudan in 1989 in an Islamist-backed coup

Gives asylum to al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 1990s

First head of state indicted by ICC in 2009, but denies accusations of war crimes in Darfur

Makes peace with southern rebels in 2005

Oversees secession of the south in 2011, leading to Sudan losing three-quarters of its oil wealth

Little is known about his private life. He has no children

President Bashir declared a state of emergency on 22 February, replacing civilian governors and other high officials with army officers. This move was sparked by a power struggle within the top echelons of the regime - the army, the ruling National Congress Party, and the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS).

Mr Bashir agreed that he would stay in office until his presidential term expires in April 2020 and not seek re-election. But his promises carried little credibility with the demonstrators.

Strength in numbers

The groups leading the protests - the Sudanese Professionals Association and a number of opposition parties - have become more organised and are developing a political platform. But their basic demand has not changed.

They say they are ready to talk to the army - but not to Mr Bashir.

Over the last weekend, the protesters converged on the Ministry of Defence, the army headquarters and President Bashir's personal residence - all within the same huge compound near the airport.

Participating in shifts, they have stayed all day and all night. Their numbers are growing every day.

A campaign of defiance:

A woman dubbed 'Kandaka', which means Nubian queen, has become a symbol for protesters

Mr Bashir has ordered the demonstrators to be dispersed, but according to reports from the notoriously leak-prone ruling elite, opinions differed as to how this should be done.

Army officers want to avoid violence, but some security chiefs and paramilitary groups are ready to use lethal force.

On at least one occasion, when security agents and paramilitaries started firing on the protesters, army units rallied to defend the crowds. There have been reports of shots exchanged between different security units. At least one junior army officer has defected to join the protesters.

Avoiding a massacre

There are fears of a massacre, akin to the killings in Tahrir Square in Cairo that heralded the collapse of the Husni Mubarak regime in Egypt.

Both sides are keenly aware of what this might entail.

One thing that the opposition has not demanded is that Mr Bashir be handed over to the International Criminal Court (ICC), where he faces prosecution for crimes committed in Darfur 15 years ago.

AFP Paramilitary forces have been accused of shooting at the protesters

For them, the fate of the country is bigger than bringing one man to justice.

But that would change if the protesters were to be gunned down in large numbers.

In the aftermath of large-scale bloodshed, the clamour for accountability would become deafening, which would put Mr Bashir in a corner with no peaceful way out.

Ever since Luis Moreno Ocampo, when he was the ICC prosecutor, demanded an arrest warrant for Mr Bashir in July 2008, the Sudanese president has known that his only safe place is in Khartoum's presidential palace.

Mr Bashir is ageing and unwell and has repeatedly said he would rather step down - but no-one has been able to guarantee his personal future should he do so.

The UN Security Council can suspend the ICC arrest warrant, but only for one year, and the UK and France are unwilling to offer that concession.

Mr Bashir's power base lies in the armed forces; over the years he has built up strong bonds of loyalty from the officer corps.

He is now seeing that allegiance slipping away as his most senior generals openly speak of taking over.

Civil war fears

The other fear is that Sudan no longer has a unified security sector.

The country has two inspiring precedents of peaceful popular uprisings removing military rulers Gen Ibrahim Abboud in 1964 and Nimeiri in 1985. In both cases, a swift, decisive and peaceful revolution was possible because the army command ordered their troops to side with the people.

Today it is different. The NISS, headed by the veteran ruthless spy chief Gen Salah Gosh, has powerful forces within the capital.

There are numerous paramilitary groups such as the Central Reserve Police and the Rapid Support Force (originally a Darfurian militia) and Islamist militia associated with the ruling party.

AFP Protesters been outside the military headquarters in Khartoum since Saturday

Each of these has its separate command and control; many of them run private businesses; and some of them have their own links to foreign countries.

For example the Rapid Support Force is paid directly by Saudi Arabia to deploy battalions to fight in Yemen; Salah Gosh has close links with the United Arab Emirates; and the Islamist militia have links to sponsors in Qatar and possibly elsewhere.

At present, Mr Bashir is the spider sitting at the centre of this web: only he has the means to keep the various groups in check.

One of the worst fears of Sudanese is that, should these armed groups fragment when he goes, the country will face civil war.

Currently there's a stalemate with everyone in Sudan and abroad positioning themselves tactically.

Voices of protest:

The possible brokers of a deal that manages a transition to democracy and avoids the perils of massacre or civil war - the US, the Arab League and the African Union - are calling for restraint, and hoping for the best.

Until now Mr Bashir has been able to manipulate and manoeuvre and keep afloat amid Sudan's turbulent elite politics.

It's been Sudan's misfortune that their large-scale popular uprisings - in 1964 and 1985 - have been staged when the international community has not been ready to support democratisation.

The same counter-cyclical mismatch appears to be happening today, when there is little international appetite for such democratic movements.

Fearful of the possibility of chaos, as followed uprisings in Libya, Syria and Yemen, Western powers are cautious, focusing on stability.

This caution risks missing the slender opportunity for snatching a solution from the teeth of potential calamity.

Doctors Without Borders says increased fighting in and around Zamzam camp has made it too dangerous to operate.

Doctors Without Borders has said it is suspending its work in a famine-stricken camp for displaced people in Sudan’s North Darfur region, as an increase in violent attacks has made it too dangerous to operate.

In a statement on Monday, the medical charity – known by its French-language acronym MSF – said fighting in and around Zamzam camp near the town of el-Fasher had made it “impossible … to continue providing medical assistance”.

“Despite widespread starvation and immense humanitarian needs, we have no choice but to take the decision to suspend all our activities in the camp, including the MSF field hospital,” the group said.

MSF was one of the few humanitarian groups still working in the camp, which houses about half a million people displaced by Sudan’s devastating 22-month civil war.

Health workers at the organisation’s field hospital in Zamzam had helped treat people wounded in attacks by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) this month, as well as provided care to thousands of malnourished children.

“Halting our project in the midst of a worsening disaster in Zamzam is a heartbreaking decision,” said Yahya Kalilah, MSF’s Sudan country director.

“The sheer proximity of the violence, great difficulties in sending supplies, the impossibility to send experienced staff for adequate support, and uncertainty regarding routes out of the camp for our colleagues and civilians leave us with little choice.”

We've taken the difficult decision to suspend our activities in Zamzam camp, North Darfur, Sudan. Violence has engulfed the camp, which hosts around 500,000 people. We urge all armed actors in the area to protect civilians.. The details: https://t.co/7zb32yoe5d — MSF International (@MSF) February 24, 2025

The war in Sudan broke out between the RSF and the Sudanese military in April 2023.

Both parties have been accused of war crimes as the United Nations says the violence has killed tens of thousands of people, forced 14 million to flee their homes and spurred a humanitarian crisis.

On February 11, the RSF stormed Zamzam, triggering two days of clashes with the army and allied armed groups and forcing about 10,000 families to flee, according to the United Nation’s International Organization for Migration (IOM).

MSF said its teams had treated 139 patients with gunshot and shrapnel wounds in its field hospital so far this month. But 11 people – including five children – died because the facility lacked the necessary equipment.

The organisation also said its ambulances were targeted in recent months.

Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday of a “further escalation” after the RSF and its allies agreed to form a parallel government.

Guterres’s spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, said the UN chief was “deeply concerned” by Sunday’s announcement. “This further escalation in the conflict… deepens the fragmentation of the country,” Dujarric said.

The RSF-led government is not expected to receive widespread recognition, with the group accused of carrying out war crimes, including genocide.

But it is a sign that the splintering of Sudan could be cementing as the RSF focuses on the western region of Darfur while it loses ground elsewhere.

Rebel RSF forces reportedly carried out ‘field executions’ and shot at people trying to flee across the Nile.

Sudanese rebels have killed hundreds of people in a three-day assault in the southern White Nile state, according to a rights watchdog.

The attacks on villages near the town of al-Gitaina by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) killed more than 200 people, Emergency Lawyers, a group tracking rights violations in the 21-month war between the Sudanese army and the RSF, said on Tuesday.

“Field executions, abductions, forced disappearances and lootings,” were carried out, the group said. Some victims drowned after being shot at while trying to flee across the Nile River, in what Emergency Lawyers branded a “massacre”.

Sudan’s army-aligned Ministry of Foreign Affairs said later the number of victims had “so far reached 433 people, including infants”.

The Paris-based Sudan Tribune reported that RSF forces killed or injured dozens on Monday alone.

A resident quoted by the media described how RSF fighters on motorbikes fanned out, opening fire on people in the streets and inside their homes.

The reported attacks come as Sudan’s government gained ground against the RSF in and around the capital, Khartoum, about 100km (62 miles) north of al-Gitaina.

On Monday, the army claimed to have regained control of the capital’s Abu Hamama neighbourhood and dismantled an RSF checkpoint connecting it with the downtown.

Turkiye’s Anadolu news agency reported that Sudan’s army now controls most areas in southern-central Khartoum.

Plans for rival governments

The RSF and aligned factions have been preparing to sign a charter this week in Nairobi to declare a parallel government in areas under RSF control.

However, the declaration of a “Government of Peace and Unity” was postponed.

Politician Fadlallah Burma Nasir, head of the National Umma Party which is split over whether to participate, said the signing of the charter had been put back to later in the week to allow for a fuller representation from rebel leader Abdelaziz al-Hilu’s SPLM-N.

The SPLM-N is a large military faction that controls wide swaths of the famine-stricken South Kordofan and Blue Nile states and had not previously taken a firm position in the conflict between the army and the RSF.

The RSF maintains control over some parts of the capital, sections of Kordofan and much of the famine-threatened Darfur region.

Sudan has been engulfed in civil strife since April 2023, with forces of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan battling fighters aligned with his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti.

Both sides have been accused of abuses and war crimes.

The war has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced more than 12 million and created what the International Rescue Committee has called the “biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded”.

Last week, Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced plans for a transitional government to pave the way for elections and end the war, as it also made strategic advances against RSF forces in the states of Sennar, Gezira and the key city of Umm Ruwaba in North Kordofan.

On Tuesday, the UN Human Rights Office warned in a report that “entrenched impunity” is prompting gross human rights violations and abuse in the country as fighting spreads to new areas.

The office has warned that the civilian death toll continues to rise as hostilities between the rival parties sharply escalate, and in its new report it called for a broader international effort towards accountability and to stem the flow of arms.

“The continued and deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian objects, as well as summary executions, sexual violence and other violations and abuses, underscore the utter failure by both parties to respect the rules and principles of international humanitarian and human rights law,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk.

“Some of these acts may amount to war crimes. They must be investigated promptly and independently, with a view to bringing those responsible to justice,” he added.

CAIRO (AP) — Sudan’s military on Sunday broke a more than yearlong siege on the crucial city of Obeid, restoring access to a strategic area in the south-central region and strengthening crucial supply routes in its nearly two years of war against a notorious paramilitary group, officials said.

The military also kicked the Rapid Support Forces from its last stronghold in the White Nile province in another setback to the notorious group, military spokesman Brig. Gen. Nabil Abdullah said in a statement.

Sudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare across the country.

The fighting, which wrecked the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups.

Abdullah, the spokesman, said military troops in the al-Sayyad axis managed to reopen the road to the city of Obeid and break the RSF siege on the city which serves as the provincial capital of North Kordofan province. The city hosts a sprawling airbase and the military’s 5th Infantry Division known as Haganah.

A commercial and transportation hub, Obeid is located on a railway linking Khartoum to Nyala, the provincial capital of South Darfur province. It was besieged by the RSF since the onset of the ongoing conflict in April 2023.

Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim hailed the military’s advances in Obeid as a “massive step” to lift the RSF siege on el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, as well as delivering humanitarian aid to the Kordofan area.

Sunday’s RSF defeats were the latest in a series of setbacks for the notorious group that started in September when the military launched an offensive aiming at recapturing the Great Khartoum area — Khartoum and its two sister cities of Omdurman and Khartoum North, or Bahri.

The military has since captured strategic areas including its own main headquarters and is now close to recapturing the Republican Palace which RSF fighters stormed in the first hours of the war in an attempt to kill military chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan.

The RSF has also suffered multiple battlefield setbacks elsewhere in the country. It lost control of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, and other areas in the province. The military also regained control of the country’s largest oil refinery.

The developments on the ground have given the military the upper hand in the war, which is approaching its 2-year mark with no peaceful settlement on the horizon. International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, have not halted the conflict.

The RSF and its allies, meanwhile, signed a charter that paved the way for the establishment of a parallel government to challenge the military-backed administration. The move has raised concerns about a potential split of the country.

Cholera spreading to another city

Cholera has spread to Rabak, the provincial capital of White Nile province, according to health authorities in the province. The disease first hit Kosti, another White Nile city, before reaching Rabak, the health ministry said.

A total of 68 people died from cholera in the two cities between Thursday and Sunday, according to the health ministry. More than 1,860 others were diagnosed with the disease, it said.

An anti-cholera vaccination campaign in Kosti and Rabak reached 67% of its targeted people in the last two days, according to the ministry.

The outbreak was blamed mainly on contaminated drinking water after Kosti’s water supply facility was knocked out during an attack by the RSF, the health ministry said. The facility was later fixed as part of the government’s efforts to fight the disease.

Cholera is a highly contagious disease that causes diarrhea leading to severe dehydration and can be fatal if not immediately treated, according to the World Health Organization. It’s transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.

Cholera outbreaks are not uncommon in Sudan. The disease killed more than 600 and sickened over 21,000 others in Sudan between July and October last year, mostly in the country’s eastern areas where millions of people displaced by the conflict were located.

When an Arab militia rampaged through Maryam Suleiman’s village in the Darfur region of Sudan last year and lined up men and boys to massacre, the gunmen were blunt about their purpose.

“We don’t want to see any Black people,” a militia leader said, adding mockingly: “We don’t even want to see black trash bags.” To make his point, Maryam recalled, he shot a donkey because it was black.

Then the militia members executed men and boys who belonged to Black African ethnic groups, she said. “They shot my five brothers, one after the other,” Maryam told me, describing how her youngest brother survived the first bullet and called out to her. Then a militia member shot him in the head and sneeringly asked her what she thought of that.

The militia tried to systematically kill all the males over 10, Maryam said, and also killed some younger ones. A 1-day-old boy was thrown to the ground and killed, and one male infant was thrown into a pond to drown, she said.

Title: Sudan: World's Dams At Risk From Climate Change and Conflict - Report

Delft, the Netherlands — When the Arbaat Dam, 38 kilometres northwest of Port Sudan, collapsed catastrophically in August, following the unusually heavy rains that have hit Sudan this year, it left a swath of death and destruction in its wake, with more than 100 dead and entire villages washed away, affecting more than 50,000 people. The collapse of the Arbaat Dam has been cited in a new report published by the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education* this week, which cautions that with the frequency and severity of extreme weather events increasing due to climate change, many of the 70,000+ dams in the world are aging, and at a higher risk of failure. This is increased in conflict zones, where dams have been 'abandoned'

The report is co-authored by Micha Werner (associate professor in drought and flood management), and Yasir Mohamed (associate professor of water resources management) at the IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, based in Delft, the Netherlands, which is the largest international graduate water education facility in the world, and operates under the auspices of UNESCO. Werner and Mohamed warn that "in conflict zones, where maintenance may be absent, or where as in the case of Jebel Aulia dam in Sudan, operators have abandoned dams due to these being in rebel-held territory, there is an increased risk of further collapses, with catastrophic impacts."

In addition to the Arbaat and Jebel Aulia dams in Sudan, the report underscores that "earlier this year, a dam collapsed in Kenya, and this week marks the first anniversary of the collapse of two dams upstream of the coastal town of Derna in Libya, devastating the town and causing an estimated 6,000 to 20,000 casualties."

The authors underscore: "Dams can also be very effective in reducing floods when well operated. Recent research shows that the world's dams can reduce the number of people exposed to projected increases of global flood risk due to climate change by 13-21 per cent."

The report explains that "the cause of the collapse of the Arbaat dam was excessive rainfall due to the current heavy monsoon season in the Sahelian region including Sudan, with the capacity of the spillway likely being exceeded and subsequent overtopping and failure of the dam. The dams upstream of Derna also collapsed as a result of extreme rainfall, due to Storm Daniel, a Mediterranean cyclone. Dams are built to withstand extreme floods, with spillways and emergency outlet structures designed to pass these safely. Still, there is always a small probability of floods larger than those the dam builders designed for. This could lead to the dam being overtopped, and subsequent dam burst."

Werner and Mohamed warn: The situation is worse in marginalised regions and conflict areas... The situation in war-torn Sudan is particularly dire. There the country's dams are divided, with some in rebel-held territory, including the Jebel Aulia dam just upstream of the capital city of Khartoum. This dam is now abandoned and its gates are essentially not operated. Coordination of flood operations of other major dams is increasingly difficult due to displacement of staff and communication challenges. Coordinated operation of these dams is essential, particularly given the ongoing heavy monsoon season, which already led to the collapse of the Arbaat dam."

In conclusion, the report cautions the wider international community that "with the frequency and severity of extreme weather events increasing due to climate change, many of the 70,000+ dams in the world are at a higher risk of failure. Additionally, the majority of the world's dams are now aging.

"The impacts of a dam collapsing are catastrophic. Arbaat and Derna were both small dams. Seventy-three percent of the world's dams are larger. The increasing risk of failure due to climate change calls for increased attention and investment. Particularly where that risk is aggravated further by conflict and instability, more effort is needed. The collapse of a dam and the suffering this causes can be averted, but appropriate action needs to be taken."

Jebel Aulia

As reported by Radio Dabanga in September, experts are warning of the state of the Jebel Aulia dam in the White Nile south of Khartoum as maintenance has not taken place since the end of last year. The failure of the dam to raise the water level of the White Nile may lead to a failed agricultural season. A collapse of the dam also threatens people in Khartoum.

The Jebel Aulia dam, 44 kilometres south of central Khartoum, was established in 1937. The reservoir, with a capacity of 3,500 million cubic metres, was originally designed to benefit Egypt by augmenting the supply of summer flow to Aswan. Since the construction of the High Aswan dam, Egypt did not longer need the Jebel Aulia dam and officially handed it over to Sudan in 1977.

The main function has become to raise the water level in the areas south of the dam on the east and west banks of the White Nile for the mechanic irrigation of agricultural projects. However, the required maintenance has not occurred since the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) took control of the area in November last year, which has led to serious concerns about the possibility to irrigate White Nile state farms in the upcoming agricultural season this winter.

In an open appeal to both the governor of White Nile state and the RSF command earlier this week, Yousef El Hasani, the head of the White Nile Farmers Association warned that the state's farms and agricultural projects depending on irrigation during the winter season are threatened due to the low level of the Nile water.

The dam operating system needs to be manned permanently to maintain the water levels in the White Nile. "The raised water level is supposed to serve the many agricultural projects in White Nile state, including national sugarcane plantations, and the damage will be large when the engineers cannot return to their jobs soon," El Hasani explained in the letter.

Sudan war: A simple guide to what is happening

Getty Images The war in Sudan has caused one of the "world's largest displacement crises", the UN has said

In April last year, Sudan was thrown into disarray when its army and a powerful paramilitary group began a vicious struggle for power.

The war, which continues to this day, has claimed more than 15,000 lives. And in what the United Nations has called one of the world's "largest displacement crises", about nine million people have been forced to flee their homes.

There have been warnings of genocide regarding the western region of Darfur, where residents say they have been targeted by fighters based on their ethnicity.

Here is what you need to know.

Where is Sudan?

Sudan is in north-east Africa and is one of the largest countries on the continent, covering 1.9 million sq km (734,000 sq miles).

The population of Sudan is predominantly Muslim and the country's official languages are Arabic and English.

Even before the war started, Sudan was one the poorest countries in the world. Its 46 million people were in 2022 living on an average annual income of $750 (£600) a head.

The conflict has made things much worse. Last year, the economy shrunk by 40%, Sudan's finance minister said.

Who is fighting who in Sudan?

After the 2021 coup, a council of generals ran Sudan, led by the two military men at the centre of this dispute:

Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the head of the armed forces and in effect the country's president

And his deputy and leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as "Hemedti".

They disagreed on the direction the country was going in and the proposed move towards civilian rule.

The main sticking points were plans to include the 100,000-strong RSF into the army, and who would then lead the new force.

The suspicions were that both generals wanted to hang on to their positions of power, unwilling to lose wealth and influence.

What are the Rapid Support Forces?

The RSF was formed in 2013 and has its origins in the notorious Janjaweed militia that brutally fought rebels in Darfur, where they were accused of ethnic cleansing against the region's non-Arabic population.

Since then, Gen Dagalo has built a powerful force that has intervened in conflicts in Yemen and Libya. He has also developed economic interests including controlling some of Sudan's gold mines.

Before the current conflict erupted, the RSF had been accused of human rights abuses, including the massacre of more than 120 protesters in June 2019.

Such a strong force outside the army has been seen as a source of instability in the country.

Why did the fighting start?

Shooting between the two sides began on 15 April 2023 following days of tension as members of the RSF were redeployed around the country in a move that the army saw as a threat.

There had been some hope that talks could resolve the situation but these never happened.

It is disputed who fired the first shot but the fighting swiftly escalated in different parts of the country.

Why is the military in charge of Sudan?

This fighting is the latest episode in bouts of tension that followed the 2019 ousting of long-serving President Omar al-Bashir, who came to power in a coup in 1989.

There were huge street protests calling for an end to his near-three decade rule and the army mounted a coup to get rid of him.

But civilians continued to campaign for the introduction of democracy.

A joint military-civilian government was then established but that was overthrown in another coup in October 2021, when Gen Burhan took over.

And since then the rivalry between Gen Burhan and Gen Dagalo has intensified.

A framework deal to put power back in the hands of civilians was agreed in December 2022 but talks to finalise the details failed.

Who controls which parts of the country?

When it began, the conflict appeared to be around the control of key installations.

However, much of it is now happening in urban areas and civilians have become unwitting victims.

The RSF captured much of the capital, Khartoum, and Darfur.

The military controls most of the north and the east, including the key Red Sea port of Port Sudan.

In a major blow to the army, the RSF seized the strategic city of Wad Madani in December, along with much of the surrounding Gezira state. Hundreds and thousands of civilians were forced to flee the city, which had become a hub for humanitarian services and a refuge for those who had escaped conflict in other parts of the country.

In February, the army recaptured the centre of Omdurman, one of three cities along the River Nile that form Sudan's wider capital, Khartoum. It regained control of the state broadcaster there - a symbolic breakthrough for the army.

Attention is now on el-Fasher, the last major urban centre in Darfur that is still held by the army. The RSF has laid siege to the city, causing hundreds of casualties, overwhelming hospitals and blocking food supplies.

How have civilians been impacted by the war?

As well as sparking major displacement, both sides in the conflict have been accused of war crimes.

When leaving his post in September, UN envoy to Sudan Volker Perthes accused the RSF of committing sexual violence, looting and killings in areas it controls. He also condemned the Sudanese armed forces for indiscriminate aerial bombings.

During the early days of the war, the BBC found that both sides had launched airstrikes and artillery fire at hospitals while patients were still in the building and doctors have also been singled out for attack. Both acts are potential war crimes.

The UN says the war has triggered the "world's worst hunger crisis". According to non-profit organisation Action Against Hunger, five million Sudanese people are dealing with "emergency levels of hunger".

Aid agencies have long complained that security threats and roadblocks have greatly hampered their effort to deliver vital goods, like food, to the people who need them.

Where have allegations of genocide come from?

In October, the BBC saw fresh evidence of ethnic cleansing in Darfur, most of which has been blamed on militias that are part of - or affiliated with - the RSF.

This year a report from campaign group Human Rights Watch said ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity had been committed against ethnic Massalit and non-Arab communities in the region by the paramilitary forces and its Arab allies.

The UK, UN, US and a number of other entities have said civilians in the state are being targeted because of their identity.

UN genocide expert Alice Wairimu Nderitu told the BBC Darfur was facing a growing risk of genocide as the world's attention remained focused on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.

The current violence has erupted out of a long history of tensions over resources between non-Arab farming communities and Arab pastoralist communities.

The RSF emerged from the Janjaweed militia, which was accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing against non-Arab communities in Darfur in 2003, after rebels took up arms, accusing the government of ignoring the region.

The RSF denies responsibility for recent ethnic cleansing in Darfur, saying it is not involved in what it describes as a "tribal conflict".

How has the world responded to the war?

The UN and other major humanitarian groups have issued several dire warnings about the situation in Sudan, accusing the international community of "forgetting" the African country.

For instance, International Crisis Group has called diplomatic efforts to end the war "lacklustre", while Amnesty International labelled the world's response "woefully inadequate".

Some international bodies have allocated funding to Sudan since the war started. In April, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a €2bn ($2.1bn; £1.7bn) aid pledge from the international community.

Foreign countries have also attempted to organise negotiations between the army and RSF. There have been several rounds of peace talks in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - but all have failed.

The African Union and UN have a shared priority - to establish a ceasefire and bring the army and the RSF together.

BBC News deputy Africa editor Anne Soy reports that both sides, especially the army, have shown an unwillingness to work towards these goals.

At the end of May, the US's request that the army return to peace talks was denied in firm terms.

Are other countries involved in the war?

According to Reuters news agency, UN experts say the RSF has been backed by neighbouring African states including Chad, Libya and South Sudan throughout the war.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been accused of arming the RSF, but the Gulf nation has denied any involvement.

This year, both the UK and the US singled out the UAE in separate appeals for outside countries to stop backing Sudan's warring parties.

There are also reports that Iranian-made armed drones have helped the army regain territory around Khartoum.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and allies on Sunday signed a charter that paved the way for the establishment of a parallel government, as Sudan’s army made advances recently against the rival groups.

The signing ceremony was held behind closed doors in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, after a highly publicized meeting last week in a building owned by the Kenyan government was condemned by the Foreign Ministry in Khartoum.

The signatories said they would establish a government of “peace and unity” despite concerns from human rights groups and the international community, which have accused RSF of committing atrocities and genocide since it started battling Sudan’s army in April 2023.

The war in Sudan has killed more than 24,000 people and driven over 14 million people — about 30% of the population — from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries.

The U.N. last week said that throughout 2024, its human rights office documented more than 4,200 civilian killings, adding that the total number is likely much higher.

Sudan’s military has gained the upper hand in the conflict as the RSF suffered multiple blows, including losing control of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira province, and other areas in the province. The Sudanese military also regained control of the country’s largest oil refinery.

The RSF appears to have lost control of the Greater Khartoum area and the cities of Omdurman and Khartoum Bahri.

Many have been killed as the RSF paramilitary forces attacked villages in the White Nile state. The region is controlled partly by the RSF and partly by the army.

Sudan's paramilitary forces launched a three-day assault near Khartoum, killing more than 200, the Emergency Lawyers network said Tuesday. The rights group said hundreds were injured or missing, and that hundreds had been subjected to "executions, kidnappings, forced disappearances and looting."

The lawyers' network said the paramilitaries shot at villagers as they were trying to cross the White Nile to escape, so some civilians may have drowned.

Children among the dead

The army-backed government's foreign ministry said in total 433 people had been killed, including children.

"Some bodies are still lying in the street, and some were killed in their homes and no one can reach them," a medical source told AFP news agency, saying it was impossible to determine the actual death toll.

The rebel Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary attacks targeted the villages of Al-Kadaris and Al-Khelwat in the White Nile state, 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of the capital.

The UN had received "horrifying reports that dozens of women were raped and hundreds of families were forced to flee," a spokesperson for Secretary General Antonio Guterres said.

Control of the White Nile state

Both factions are currently trying to gain control over the White Nile State, which stretches from the south of Khartoum to the border with South Sudan.

The army is in control of southern areas, whereas the RSF holds northern parts.



The lawyers' network on Tuesday said the army had conducted "barbaric" attacks on civilians east of Khartoum.

The UN human rights body said on Tuesday that "summary executions, sexual violence and other violations and abuses underscore the utter failure" by both sides to respect international humanitarian law.

Civil war in Sudan

Sudan has been embroiled in a war since April 2023.

The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives, displaced more than 12 million and driven hundreds of thousands into famine.

More than 24.6 million people — around half of Sudan's population — face "high levels of acute food insecurity," according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification initiative, backed by the United Nations.

The International Rescue Committee has called it the "biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded."

Read time: ~6 minutes Read time: ~6 minutes 30.4 million people in humanitarian need, the largest humanitarian crisis since records began

Over 12 million people forcibly displaced since April 2023, the largest and fastest displacement crisis in the world

Sudan is facing one of the world’s worst hunger crises in decades Support the IRC's response

Each year, the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) Emergency Watchlist analyzes which countries are most likely to experience a new or worsening humanitarian crisis. For the second consecutive year, Sudan tops the list as the country’s collapse accelerates amidst a brutal civil war that has a devastating impact on civilians.

Before the war erupted in April 2023, Sudan was already experiencing a severe humanitarian crisis that left 15.8 million people in need of humanitarian aid. Two years of war have gravely exacerbated these conditions, displacing over 12 million people and leaving 30.4 million people—more than half of Sudan’s population—in need of humanitarian support.

Sudan now represents the largest and fastest displacement crisis in the world. It is also the largest humanitarian crisis ever recorded.

Learn more about this ongoing crisis below.

What do the people of Sudan face today?

Two years of civil war have decimated Sudan. Civilians are subject to frequent attacks and human rights violations while the country’s health care system has collapsed and life-threatening famine sets in. Attacks on humanitarian aid workers have made it difficult to deliver lifesaving aid to some of the most fragile and vulnerable communities in the world.

War continues to rage in Sudan

Sudan’s civil war, waged between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), erupted on April 15, 2023, plunging the country into chaos. Civilians bear the brunt of the conflict; sexual violence is widespread, fighters on both sides regularly target civilians and infrastructure, and child soldier recruitment is common. Human rights groups have accused fighters in Darfur of ethnic cleansing.

Tens of thousands have been killed, with indiscriminate attacks on civilians being reported.

Rather than advancing diplomacy, outside powers are fueling the conflict by funneling weapons to their allies. SAF and RSF leaders appear to believe that continued fighting best serves their interests, leaving Sudan on a trajectory toward catastrophic humanitarian collapse.

“Enough is enough. More words can no longer capture the catastrophic toll of this devastating conflict on over 30 million lives; the failure of diplomatic actors to respond effectively has allowed Sudan’s crisis to worsen beyond measure,” says IRC East Africa Advocacy Coordinator, Anne Marie Schryer.

Sudan is the world’s largest and fastest displacement crisis

The war in Sudan has created extreme levels of displacement, both internally and across Sudan’s borders. More than 12 million people have been displaced since April 2023, nearly 4 million people—mostly women and children—who have fled to neighboring countries.

Compounding the crisis, heavy rains and flooding from June 2024 to September 2024 have affected nearly 600,000 people, displacing over 172,500 individuals and causing severe destruction of homes and infrastructure, and contributing to a resurging outbreak of cholera. The worst-hit areas, including Red Sea and North Darfur, face heightened risks of famine, further exacerbating the challenges for residents already grappling with conflict and instability.

While neighboring countries—like Chad and South Sudan—have welcomed Sudanese refugees fleeing conflict, they do not have the resources to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of those arriving across the border without international support.

Famine grips communities

Famine is spreading across Sudan. Violence severely hinders humanitarians’ ability to deliver food where it's needed most. Soaring food prices and a collapse of food supply are having a devastating impact on the people of Sudan.

More than 24 million people in Sudan are facing acute food insecurity. Over 635,000 people, including in the country’s largest camp for displaced people, are experiencing famine conditions and a heightened risk of death. The severe food shortage also prevents people from getting basic nutrients, putting them at heightened risk of illnesses and infections.

Sudan has more people living in famine conditions than the rest of the world combined.

“This crisis is entirely man-made,” explains IRC country director for Sudan, Eatizaz Yousif. “The ongoing conflict has decimated livelihoods, displaced millions, and blocked life-saving aid from reaching those in desperate need.”

The IRC urgently calls on all parties to the conflict to allow immediate and unfettered humanitarian access to those in need and immediately cease hostilities.

A health system on the brink of collapse

The war in Sudan has destroyed the country’s public infrastructure, including the health system. The World Health Organization (WHO) verified at least 119 attacks on health care between April 2023 and October 2024, but the true figure is likely much higher. More than 80% of the country’s hospitals in conflict zones are non-operational, leaving millions without access to essential medical care as disease outbreaks surge.

An estimated 3.4 million children under five are at high risk of epidemic diseases. Sudan’s Ministry of Health has reported over 60,000 cholera cases and more than 1,600 deaths between August 2024 and May 2025.

“Sudan is on the brink of a full-scale public health disaster,” explains IRC Sudan country director, Eatizaz Yousif.

“The combination of conflict, displacement, destroyed critical infrastructure and limited access to clean water is fueling the resurgence of cholera and other deadly diseases.”

Women and children face heightened risks

The ongoing crisis in Sudan is taking a devastating toll on women and girls. The collapse of critical healthcare services has put new mothers at risk of losing their lives in the months ahead as it has become nearly impossible to access essential reproductive care.

Gender-based violence is escalating. Reports of intimate partner violence, sexual exploitation, abuse and trafficking are widespread, while survivors struggle to access support. Economic hardship has stripped countless women of their livelihoods, forcing many into desperate and exploitative situations, and increasing their vulnerability.

In Darfur, the crisis has deepened amidst ongoing fighting that targets civilians, continued displacement and the declaration of famine. Alarming reports of sexual violence underscore the immense suffering endured by those in dire conditions, revealing the exceptional vulnerability of women and children.

Urgent action is needed to address these atrocities and provide support to those affected.

How is the IRC helping in Sudan?

In response to increasing needs, the IRC has scaled up its humanitarian efforts despite immense challenges, including office closures and suspensions due to security concerns. We are supporting Sudanese communities, both within the country and across national borders by delivering:

Shortly after conflict broke out in April 2023, the IRC established a presence in Wad Madani, Al Jazirah state where we delivered health and nutrition services to IDPs fleeing Khartoum until we were forced to close the office and relocate our staff. We are currently operational in Blue Nile, Khartoum, Gedaref, River Nile, South Kordofan and White Nile states, and have an office in Port Sudan.

We are delivering direct support to clients in accessible areas of Khartoum, as well as indirect support through our locally-based community partners.

How is the IRC helping Sudanese refugees?

Nearly 4 million asylum seekers have sought refuge in neighboring countries since April 2023. In response, the IRC has scaled up our critical services to support Sudanese refugees, including in Uganda, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Chad—which already hosted 400,000 Sudanese refugees prior to the war.

More than ninety percent of the 850,000 Sudanese refugees who have arrived in Chad since April 2023 are women and children. One-fifth of young children who arrive are experiencing acute malnutrition.

“The fact that women and children make up such a large proportion of the new arrivals in Chad is particularly worrying because they are often the most vulnerable groups in conflict situations,” explains IRC Deputy Regional Director of Central Africa, Aleksandra Roulet-Cimpric. “Women and children are at greater risk of violence, exploitation and abuse, and they may also face difficulties accessing basic necessities such as food, water and healthcare.”

In Chad, the IRC is facing a humanitarian situation reaching a breaking point, with the country receiving more than 68,000 from Sudan in the last 30 days alone. Chad now hosts over a million refugees, including over 800,000 arrivals from Sudan since the conflict began.

Health centers near the Sudan border in Birak and Mile Extension, Wadi-Fira province, are struggling to keep up. These facilities are running low on essential medicines and lack specialized care for mental health and reproductive health needs. Meanwhile, over 100,000 children in Eastern Chad are facing severe acute malnutrition as of April 2025.

The IRC is making a vital impact in Birak and Guereda through mobile clinics, delivering life-saving care to both refugees and host communities. Services include malnutrition treatment, prenatal care, gender-based violence support, and mental health consultations.

Despite reaching more than 10,000 people with disease prevention and nutrition education, thousands still face dire circumstances as needs escalate.

CNN —

Fighters from Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have torched swathes of the country’s largest refugee camp, firing indiscriminately at civilians, according to open-source data and an eyewitness account.

At least seven people have been killed and 40 injured in the attacks which began on Tuesday, according to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which operates one of the last remaining healthcare facilities in Zamzam camp, which hosts nearly half a million displaced people suffering from famine. Approximately 50% of Zamzam’s central market was burned in the attacks, according to a new Yale HRL report.

Once a refuge for civilians fleeing violence in North Darfur’s capital city of al-Fasher and neighboring towns, Zamzam has been under fire since December 1, according to Yale’s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL) which monitors the conflict, and MSF. Indiscriminate artillery fire has killed and injured dozens of residents since, the medical relief group says.

The RSF and its rival, the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), have been locked in a brutal civil war since April of 2023. Since then, the RSF has been campaigning to capture al-Fasher —the last remaining SAF stronghold in the region — 15km north of Zamzam. However, this is the first time that RSF fighters appear to have entered the camp.

CNN reviewed eyewitness testimony, open-source data and spoke with humanitarian groups operating locally to illuminate the RSF’s back-to-back assaults on Zamzam.

‘I saw people fleeing, and I was among them’

On Tuesday, RSF fighters approached the camp from the east before entering the central market, according to an eyewitness who spoke to CNN.

Footage verified from social media illustrates the RSF’s advance; videos show armed fighters wearing the RSF’s hallmark tan camouflage and insignia capturing a militia outpost on the edge of the camp.

Then, less than half a kilometer south, fighters appear closer to the camp, perched atop pickup trucks with mounted belt-fed machine guns. The camera pans across the ground, littered with bullet casings, and briefly shows a plume of dark black smoke which appears to emanate from Zamzam’s central market.

The eyewitness described how the fighters set several shops ablaze before he fled the camp in terror.

“I saw people fleeing, and I was among them—some in their private vehicles and others on foot for hundreds of meters. Several stray bullets flew over our heads, and a victim fell right in front of me,” he recounted.

Dozens of children, women, and elderly people were killed and injured in the attacks, according to a statement released by Zamzam camp administrators on Thursday. The statement calls on the United Nations to deploy an international protection mission after “the [RSF] resorted to the scorched land policy, brutally targeting Zamzam.”

Satellite imagery shared by Maxar Technologies and footage posted on social media by North Darfur’s governor show the aftermath of large-scale burning throughout Zamzam’s central marketplace. Among the ash, remnants of the stands, chairs, and tables piled with charred vegetables can be seen.

Heat signatures recorded by NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System show that the fire ignited on Tuesday, causing damage that HRL says is “consistent with intentional razing” identified after nearby arson attacks perpetrated by the RSF.

The RSF did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for comment but characterized Zamzam camp as a “military garrison” in a statement posted to Telegram.

“We categorically affirm that no violations have occurred, and our forces have never targeted civilians. Rather, our forces operated with military professionalism, swiftly defeating the armed elements, seizing their weapons stockpiles, forcing them to flee the camp, and thwarting their plan to use civilians as human shields.”

The attack, which unfolded over two days, was launched weeks after the RSF began targeting the camp with long-range artillery in early December, according to a Yale HRL report.

One video posted on Facebook by a spokesperson for the camp on December 18 shows the aftermath of a strike in central Zamzam. The footage, verified by CNN, shows the smoldering remains of three homes, which are difficult to make out against the singed earth.

While CNN was unable to recover imagery showing munitions fragments from the scene, Yale HRL researchers identified RSF heavy artillery within firing range of the strike just days before the video surfaced. HRL’s findings are based on their review of satellite imagery following strikes on the camp.

The RSF claims that the camp is a “military base, housing weapons and ammunition depots as well as operations command rooms,” in the context of the paramilitary group’s wider offensive to capture al-Fasher — the last remaining bastion for government forces in North Darfur, according to Liam Karr, Africa team lead at the Institute for the Study of War. But these attacks on Zamzam extend “beyond military objectives into ethnic cleansing and genocide,” Karr says.

The RSF’s claim that its rivals are using refugees as human shields is a pretext “to indiscriminately target the hundreds of thousands of refugees in the camp as SAF sympathizers,” Karr told CNN.

Last month, former U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the RSF of committing genocide in Sudan, and imposed sanctions on its leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti.

“We spent serious muscle pressuring the RSF to stop attacking Zamzam,” a former senior official told CNN. “Sadly, RSF leaders are savvy enough to realize that the new administration isn’t even paying attention.”

The RSF called the Biden Administration’s sanctions “regrettable and unjust” in a statement posted to Telegram, claiming that they were “politically motivated and… without an independent and thorough investigation.”

In the midst of a raging malnutrition crisis

Zamzam has long been at the epicenter of the malnutrition crisis in Sudan. Last August, the World Food Program declared that the camp had been pushed into famine.

In the weeks before the RSF entered the camp, CNN gathered testimonies from residents and healthcare providers in Zamzam, which paint a stark image: parents going hungry to feed their children and whole families rationing small packets of Plumpy’Nut, a thick, peanut paste made to treat malnourished children.

One mother, holding her crying two-year-old child, explained the challenge of finding fresh water: “When we need water, we need to pay. And we don’t have money, so we ask Allah to sustain us,” she says.

About 34% of children living in Zamzam camp suffer from acute malnutrition—more than twice the emergency threshold—according to an MSF survey conducted in the fall.

An eyewitness described to CNN the healthcare situation as “extremely dire” in the days before the RSF’s attacks this week.

Since the famine declaration, malnutrition has persisted and spread to two additional camps in North Darfur and the Western Nuba Mountains and is predicted to reach five additional localities in the state before May.

The RSF’s attacks on Zamzam have worsened the malnutrition crisis by forcing humanitarian groups like MSF to suspend certain aspects of their operations, MSF Secretary General Chris Lockyear told CNN after visiting the Darfur region in December.

Faced with continuing security threats, he says, “it’s simply too dangerous” to operate in certain areas of North Darfur. It is immediately unclear how this recent spate of violence will affect the malnutrition crisis in Zamzam.

“As the camp is surrounded [by RSF fighters], there is no possibility for the population to flee or for humanitarian aid to enter,” MSF’s Project Coordinator in North Darfur Marion Ramstein predicts. “People are left with nothing.”

The Sudanese Foreign Minister, on a visit to Moscow on Wednesday, said he "is grateful" to Russia for its support in the United Nations Security Council.

Ali Yousuf Ahmed Al-Sharif, speaking during a joint press conference with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, said that attempts to pass a resolution in the Security Council that would pave the way for international UN forces to intervene in Sudan were blocked by Moscow.

"Of course, we reject this intervention in Sudanese affairs, he said.

“We have come here to thank the leadership, government, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation for their supportive stance on Sudan in the United Nations Security Council."

Al-Sharif added that “we are working together for peace, stability, respect for nations, and national sovereignty."

Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in 2019.

A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.

The RSF and Sudan’s military began fighting each other in 2023.

Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people and forced millions to flee their homes.

World ignoring risk of Sudan genocide - UN expert

Clashes have intensified in the battle for control of the city

More than 700 casualties have been reported in 10 days by a medical charity in the city.

She said many civilians were targeted based on their ethnicity in Sudan's besieged city of El Fasher, where fierce fighting has intensified in recent days.

"We do have circumstances in which a genocide could be occurring or has occurred," the UN Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, told BBC's Newsday programme.

Sudan's Darfur region is facing a growing risk of genocide as the world's attention is focused on conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, a UN expert warns.

El Fasher is the last major urban centre in the Darfur region that remains in the hands of Sudan's army.

The military has been fighting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for more than a year, in a civil war that has killed thousands and forced millions from their homes.

Local resident Ibrahim al-Tayeb al-Faki told the BBC his sister was killed in a military airstrike that had also destroyed his home.

The 47-year-old told the BBC he had sent his three children to live with their grandfather but his house was also hit. The family is now sheltering in its ruins.

“There is no safe place in El Fasher right now,” he said.

The situation is unfolding to a "Rwanda-like" genocide of 1994, Ms Nderitu said, citing a UN analysis on the increasing risk factors.

"Increased hostilities in El Fasher have now opened a really alarming chapter in this conflict," she added.

"I'm calling for attention to this particular conflict. I have been trying to get my voice out but my voice is drowned out by other wars - in Ukraine and Gaza."

Similar fears of a possible genocide in Darfur were expressed by Human Rights Watch (HRW) recently.

A report from the campaign group said ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity had been committed against ethnic Massalit and non-Arab communities in the region by the paramilitary forces and its Arab allies.

It called for sanctions against those responsible for the atrocities, including the RSF leader, Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti.

The current violence has erupted out of a long history of tensions over resources between non-Arab farming communities, including the Massalit, and Arab pastoralist communities.

The internet has been cut making access to the city difficult, as soldiers from the RSF group continue to besiege the city.

The UN says about 15,000 people are feared to have been killed in the West Darfur city of El Geneina last year.

Last June, West Darfur Governor Khamis Abakar was killed hours after accusing the RSF of committing genocide. He is the most senior official known to have been killed since the conflict began in April.

The RSF says it is not involved in what it describes as a "tribal conflict" in Darfur.

The paramilitary group emerged from the Janjaweed militia which was accused of genocide and ethnic cleansing against non-Arab communities in Darfur in 2003, after rebels took up arms, accusing the government of ignoring the region.

Sudan’s military captured a major bridge connecting the east of the capital Khartoum to the south, days after it reclaimed control of its northern part from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

As the conflict in Sudan nears the two-year mark, the army has in recent weeks won back large swaths of the capital and its surrounding areas from the paramilitary group.

RSF still controls some key positions, including the central market, the presidential palace, and some of the southern and western residential districts.

It also holds parts of the central region of Kordofan, most of the western region of Darfur, and is besieging the army and its allies in the city of el-Fashir, the capital of north Darfur.

Residents and medics on Friday said the RSF attacked the famine-stricken Zamzam displacement camp, south of el-Fashir, as the group attempted to tighten its grip on the Darfur stronghold.

An estimated 11.4 million civilians have been forced from their homes since the conflict began in April 2023. Three million are refugees in neighbouring countries, while more than eight million are internally displaced.

“Sudan’s regional neighbours say they want the conflict to end,” Al Jazeera’s Mohamed Vall said, reporting from Sudan’s Sennar. “Peace efforts were made in Jeddah, Cairo, Addis Ababa, Geneva and elsewhere. But all have so far failed.

“Both the RSF and the army say they’re ready to talk but with caveats and conditions unacceptable to the other side. Both still believe they can achieve total victory on the battlefield.”

‘Tremendous destruction and bloodshed’

Speaking on Friday at a high-level humanitarian conference in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the situation in Sudan as a catastrophe on a “staggering scale and brutality”.

“It is a crisis that demands sustained and urgent attention,” he told participants, stressing the need to stop the movement of arms and ammunition into the country.

“This flow is enabling the continuation of tremendous civilian destruction and bloodshed,” Guterres added.

Nearly 25 million people are suffering from “acute” levels of hunger, according to UN figures, and delivering aid requires a ceasefire to be put in place.

Guterres called on world leaders to use their influence for peace and boost humanitarian aid efforts ahead of the holy month of Ramadan.

“We must do more – and do more now – to help the people of Sudan out of this nightmare.”

Greater protections - but no way to access them

Illegal, dangerous routes far outpace resettlement slots from Chad, Libya or Tunisia. Only 1,100 refugees were resettled from Libya in 2023, out of some 60,000 registered by the UNHCR. Sudanese people still have to pay smugglers to cross the Sahara and the Mediterranean.

In February 2024, a boat with 42 Sudanese passengers sank off Tunisia. Two were rescued, and the others were reported dead or missing.

According to one of the survivors who spoke by phone to Al Jazeera, 38 passengers, including him, were Masalit from West Darfur, fleeing mass killings, and who ought to have qualified for asylum if they had managed to reach Europe.

In the Global North, some countries, like the United States or France, have shown more openness to granting Sudanese applicants asylum or at least temporary protection status. Since July, the French asylum court qualified large parts of Sudan, including Khartoum and most of Darfur, as suffering “a situation of blind violence of exceptional intensity”, giving applicants from those regions the right to immediate protection in France. Similar decisions have been taken in Belgium and the United Kingdom.

But European countries are still throwing resources at preventing the boat crossings.

Since 2017, European support for the Libyan Coast Guard has enabled the interception of up to 32,000 refugees and migrants a year.

Each time new routes have opened up, the EU has been quick to negotiate partnerships with transit countries to block them.

In July last year, for example, immediately after the violence in Sfax and the beginning of the ensuing pushbacks, the European Commission and some member states struck a $112m deal with Tunisia.

In March, Egypt was promised $215m in funding.

Those who do make it as far as northern France can expect long delays once they get there.

Calais is a real bottleneck on the route: many Sudanese reach the town one or two months after leaving their country, then spend many more months on daily unsuccessful attempts to cross to the UK.

The morning before we met, as on every morning since he had arrived five months before, Issa attempted to board a truck to the UK. He jumped onto the moving vehicle at a roundabout, managed to climb onto the roof, opened the tarpaulin and slipped into the load.

The lorry boarded a ferry, but once it was on board, British police dogs located him. He was handed over to the French police, who detained him in Calais port’s police station for four hours.

Since 2020, tighter checks on the trucks have made the boats option more popular, but the Sudanese are said to seldom take the sea route just because they can’t afford the rates, which are much higher than on the Mediterranean.

“We don’t pay, no Sudanese pays,” Issa says. Some pretend to have paid, beg a place, agree to take the helm even if it means risking prison in the UK, where prosecutions often focus on the people identified as “captains” of the boats, or threaten to stab the boat with a knife if they’re not taken.

That night, Issa crept onto the beach and tried to smuggle himself onto a “plastic” (a dinghy). He had only tried the small boats five or six times before. “Sometimes we have to fight with the Afghans to board, but last night there was no violence,” he says.

The 25 mostly Afghan paying passengers allowed 15 Sudanese to join them. But the police intervened and stabbed the boat.

“We ran away,” says Issa. “Many others left last night, but we don’t know if they arrived.”

Sudan's 'invisible crisis' - where more children are fleeing war than anywhere else

27 November 2024 Share Save Lyse Doucet BBC News, Kassala Share Save

Joyce Liu / BBC More than five million children have fled their homes in Sudan

Mahmoud is a cheeky teenager who beams the biggest of smiles even though he lost his front teeth in the rough and tumble of kids’ play. He is a Sudanese orphan abandoned twice, and displaced twice in his country’s grievous war - one of nearly five million Sudanese children who have lost almost everything as they are pushed from one place to the next in what is now the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Nowhere else on Earth are so many children on the run, so many people living with such acute hunger. Famine has already been declared in one area - many others subsist on the brink of starvation not knowing where their next meal will come from. "It’s an invisible crisis," emphasises the UN’s new humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher. "Twenty-five million Sudanese, more than half the country, need help now," he adds. In a time of all too many unprecedented crises, where devastating wars in places like Gaza and Ukraine dominate the world’s aid and attention, Mr Fletcher chose Sudan for his first field mission to highlight its plight. "This crisis is not invisible to the UN, to our humanitarians on the front line risking and losing their lives to help the Sudanese people," he told the BBC, as we travelled with him on his week-long trip. Most of the people on his team working on the ground are also Sudanese who have lost their homes, their old lives, in this brutal struggle for power between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Mr Fletcher's first field visit took him to Mahmoud’s Maygoma orphanage in Kassala in eastern Sudan, now home to nearly 100 children in a crumbling three-storey school-turned-shelter. They lived with their carers in the capital, Khartoum, until the army and RSF turned their guns on each other in April 2023, trapping the orphanage as they dragged their country into a vortex of horrific violence, systematic looting and shocking abuse. When fighting spread to the orphans’ new shelter in Wad Madani, in central Sudan, those who survived fled to Kassala. When I asked 13-year-old Mahmoud to make a wish, he immediately broke into a big gap-toothed grin. "I want to be a state governor so I can be in charge and rebuild destroyed homes," he replied.

For 11 million Sudanese driven from one refuge to the next, returning to what is left of their homes and rebuilding their lives would be the biggest gift of all. For now, even finding food to survive is a daily battle. And for aid agencies, including the UN, getting it to them is a titanic task. After Mr Fletcher’s four days of high-level meetings in Port Sudan, army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan announced on the X social media site that he had given the UN permission to establish more supply hubs and to use three more regional airports to deliver assistance. Some of the permissions had been granted before but some marked a step forward. The new announcement also came as the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) secured a green light to reach stricken communities behind lines controlled by the RSF, including the Zamzam camp in Darfur housing about half a million people where famine was recently confirmed. "We’ve been pushing for months to get to these communities," says Alex Marianelli, who heads WFP’s operations in Port Sudan. Behind us in a WFP warehouse, Sudanese labourers sing as they load trucks with boxes of food heading for the worst of the worst areas. Mr Marianelli reflects that he has never worked in such a difficult and dangerous environment.

Joyce Liu / BBC About 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict

Within the aid community, some criticise the UN, saying that its hands have been tied by recognising Gen Burhan as the de facto ruler of Sudan. "Gen Burhan and his authorities control those checkpoints and the system of permits and access," Mr Fletcher says in response. "If we want to go into those areas we need to deal with them." He hopes the rival RSF will also put the people first. "I’ll go anywhere, talk to anyone, to get this aid through, and to save lives," Mr Fletcher adds. In Sudan’s merciless war, all warring parties have been accused of using starvation as a weapon of war. So too sexual violence, which the UN describes as "an epidemic" in Sudan. The UN visit coincided with the "16 days of activism" marked globally as a campaign to stop gender-based violence. In Port Sudan, the event in a displaced camp, the first to be set up when war flared, was especially poignant. "We have to do better, we must do better," vowed Mr Fletcher, who cast aside his prepared speech when he stood under a canopy facing rows of Sudanese women and children, clapping and ululating.

I asked some of the women listening what they made of his visit. "We really need help but the major job should be from the Sudanese themselves," reflects Romissa, who works for a local aid group and recounts her own harrowing journey from Khartoum at the start of the war. "This is the time for the Sudanese people to stand together." The Sudanese have been trying to do a lot with a little. In a simple two-room shelter, a safe house called Shamaa, or "Candle", brings some light to the lives of abused single women and orphaned children. Its founder, Nour Hussein al-Sewaty, known as Mama Nour, also started life in the Maygoma orphanage. She also had to flee Khartoum to protect those in her care. One woman now sheltering with her was raped before the war, then abducted and raped again. Even the formidable Mama Nour is now at breaking-point. "We are so exhausted. We need help," she declares. "We want to smell the fresh air. We want to feel there are still people in the world who care about us, the people of Sudan."

The world’s worst internal displacement crisis, with at least 14 million people uprooted from their homes, is in Sudan.

The war in Sudan is nearing the two-year mark and the enormous suffering of its people continues.

As two powerful armed rivals tear the country apart in what has been termed an “existential battle”, millions have had to flee their homes, hundreds of thousands have been killed, and countless others are going hungry or being abused.

On April 15, 2023, Sudan was plunged into conflict as longstanding tensions between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) leader Mohamed Hamdan “Hemedti” Dagalo erupted into war.

Nearly 9,000 recorded attacks

Between April 15, 2023, and October 25, 2024, the warring sides exchanged a total of 8,942 attacks, averaging 16 a day, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), a crisis mapping organisation.

Geographically, three-quarters of all attacks have centred around three main regions:

Khartoum

More than half of all attacks, 4,858 or 54 percent of all recorded incidents, have been documented around the capital, Khartoum.

Sudan’s army has in recent months launched a major offensive there to reclaim areas seized by the RSF at the beginning of the conflict.

Gezira State

Gezira, Sudan’s agricultural hub south of Khartoum, has seen 1,077 attacks, or about 12 percent of recorded incidents.

North Darfur

Darfur – a western region divided into five states – and its people have long suffered from internal conflict. In North Darfur, there were at least 818 attacks, or 9 percent of all recorded incidents.

Rest of Sudan

The remaining 25 percent of the fighting has been spread across the country, including in South Darfur (361 attacks), North Kordofan (335 attacks) and West Darfur (269 attacks).

The map below highlights the locations of these attacks.

Tens of thousands of people killed

According to ACLED, at least 24,000 people have been reported killed across Sudan, though the actual death toll is likely much higher – especially when accounting for indirect deaths such as the spread of disease, malnutrition and lack of adequate healthcare.

About one-third of recorded deaths have occurred in Khartoum, which has the highest casualty rate.

West Darfur follows with 17 percent and North Darfur with 15 percent, highlighting the severe toll of continuing violence in these areas.

Exchange of fire

According to ACLED, Sudan’s army has carried out 4,805 attacks, accounting for 54 percent of reported incidents.

The RSF has conducted 3,069 attacks, making up 34 percent of total recorded incidents.

Other groups, including Darfur Communal Militia, Darfur Arab Militia, Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, Twic Clan Militia and others have been behind the remaining 1,068 (12 percent) of attacks.

Timeline of attacks

After months of tensions, on April 15, 2023, heavy gunfire and explosions erupted in Khartoum, a city of 10 million people.

Gunfire was heard in the vicinity of army headquarters and the Ministry of Defence, the presidential palace and Khartoum International Airport.

By the end of August 2023, attacks reached their highest intensity, with 675 combined attacks recorded.

That month, the UN reported one million people had fled the country and internal displacement exceeded 3.4 million.

Following a brief decline in attacks, violence again intensified in January 2024.

By then, the UN had reported that eight million people were displaced by the war as famine loomed across the country.

On September 26, 2024, the Sudanese army carried out air raids against RSF positions in the capital in its biggest such assault in months.

Who controls what in Sudan?

The conflict in Sudan has fragmented Africa’s third-largest country, primarily divided between the army, the RSF and several smaller armed groups.

The RSF, whose power base is in Darfur, have largely driven the army out of that region and now control most of it.

The main exception is el-Fasher, North Darfur’s capital, which remains under the control of former rebel groups.

Meanwhile, both groups have continued to fight over Khartoum with the army holding the northern parts of the capital, as well as several strategic nearby areas including White Nile, Blue Nile and Gadarif states.

14 million people displaced

The UN has warned that Sudan is facing the world’s worst displacement crisis, as the war continues with no end in sight.

About 30 percent of Sudan’s 48 million population – more than 14 million people – have been forced to flee their homes due to the war.

Of those, at least 11 million people have been displaced within the country, according to the latest figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM).

At least three million people have crossed international borders, placing immense strain on neighbouring countries, such as Chad, South Sudan, and Egypt.

The main regions of origin for displaced people are:

Khartoum: 3.7 million displaced (33 percent of the total)

3.7 million displaced (33 percent of the total) South Darfur: 2.1 million displaced (19 percent)

2.1 million displaced (19 percent) North Darfur: 1.6 million displaced (14.3 percent)

The main destinations for the internally displaced people are:

South Darfur: 1.8 million displaced (17 percent of the total)

1.8 million displaced (17 percent of the total) North Darfur: 1.5 million displaced (14 percent)

1.5 million displaced (14 percent) Gedaref: about one million displaced (9 percent)

Despite numerous attempts to negotiate a ceasefire, the violence shows little sign of abating, leaving millions in urgent need of assistance.

The army’s recapture of the agricultural and trading hub will mean the opposition Rapid Support Forces (RSF) will be cut off from various parts of the country.

Sudan’s army has recaptured Wad Madani, a strategically important city some 200km (124 miles) southeast of the capital Khartoum, in a major blow to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).

“The leadership of the Armed Forces congratulates our people on the entry of our forces into Wad Madani this morning. They are now working to clean up the remaining rebel pockets inside the city,” an army statement read.

This comes as the army advanced into the country’s second-largest city Omdurman last week after making steady gains in recent months. Wad Madani – the crossroads of key supply highways linking several states – had been under RSF control since December 2023.

RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, however, insisted that the battle was not over. “Today we lost a round, we did not lose the battle,” said Dagalo, who is also known as Hemedti.

Since fighting erupted in April 2023 between the army and the RSF over control of this North African nation, more than 12 million people have been displaced, creating one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises.

So how significant is the recapture of Wad Madani by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)? Can the army repeat its recent success as it aims to recapture territories still under RSF control?

How strategically placed is Wad Madani? Where is it located?

The city is the capital of Gezira state, located in the centre of the country and south of Khartoum.

According to Al Jazeera’s Hiba Morgan, whoever has control of the agricultural and trading hub has easier access to other parts of the country.

“When the RSF took over Wad Madani in December 2023, that gave it the ability to be able to move to other parts of the country such as Sennar in the southeast, Blue Nile in the east, and the White Nile in the south as well,” Morgan said, reporting from the Sudanese capital.

The city is also at “a very important point” through which supplies and other “logistical arrangements” can be made into the capital, according to Hamid Khalafallah, a Sudan policy analyst and PhD candidate at the University of Manchester.

“Whoever controls Madani [has] a lot more flexibility in terms of different stuff into Khartoum and out of Khartoum,” Khalafallah told Al Jazeera.

In the early days of the conflict, before the RSF took over, the city was a safe haven for displaced families.

Since the RSF’s takeover, it has been one of the sites of the paramilitary force’s bloodiest attacks on civilians, as well as the burning of fields, looting of hospitals and markets, and flooding of irrigation ditches.

Has the Sudanese army captured the entire Gezira state?

No, the RSF still retains control of most of the state, as well as nearly all of Sudan’s western Darfur region and large parts of the country’s south.

The army’s takeover of the strategic city follows its bolstered campaign to retake Gezira in recent months, after retaking Sennar state in the south.

The army was helped by the turn of events in October, when RSF’s top commander in the state defected to the SAF. The commander’s troops took part in Saturday’s operations.

Last week, the army advanced in the second-largest city Omdurman, capturing several areas from the RSF.

How significant is the recapture of Wad Madani city?

This represents a significant turn of events in the war and another blow to the RSF, which has had an upper hand against the military in the nearly two-year conflict.

The army’s capture will allow it to access other parts of the country that the RSF will now be cut off from, such as the Sennar, Blue Nile, and White Nile states.

“Now that [the RSF] lost that territory, that progress that it was able to make will not be possible, and its forces in those areas will be trapped between forces of the Sudanese army,” said Morgan.

“Wad Madani is also where the army’s first infantry division is located, so that is going to give the army a morale boost,” she added.

When the RSF took over the city, there were a lot of complaints among officers and soldiers that the leadership was not meeting the standards of the Sudanese army and that there should be a replacement of the leadership, explained Morgan.

“Now that Wad Madani is back under the control of the Sudanese army, the army is likely to gain – especially its leadership – is likely to gain more support, not just from the soldiers and officers but also from the Sudanese citizens as well,” she said.

Additionally, the city’s recapture could aid in Sudan’s hunger crisis, as the state is home to Sudan’s most fertile lands and agriculture schemes – with most farming prohibited under the RSF, said Khalafallah, the researcher.

“Now there will be room for people to grow, and to farm, and for food to be produced, and so on, to address Sudan’s unfolding famine and food security crisis,” he said.

The turn of events may also offer long-awaited respite to the city’s residents, who “have been experiencing the most horrific human rights violations and atrocities committed by the [Rapid] Support Forces”, Khalafallah said.

Still, there has been a pattern of the army targeting pro-democracy activists in the cities they have already recaptured, Khalafallah warned, which could be a worrying development if repeated in Wad Madani.

How much territory does the army control now?

Beyond Wad Madani, the Sudanese army also controls the north and east of the country, as well as parts of the capital. The map below indicates areas of control between the SAF and the RSF, as of October 2024.

How did Sudanese people react to the capture?

In Wad Madani, Sudanese troops garbed in camo-print uniforms waved their rifles in the air as they rode through town on the back of their trucks, flashing smiles after claiming to “liberate” the city, social media footage verified by Al Jazeera shows.

The local resistance committee, one of hundreds of pro-democracy volunteer groups across the country coordinating front-line aid, hailed the advance as an end to “the tyranny” of the RSF.

Meanwhile, eyewitnesses in army-controlled cities across Sudan reported dozens jubilantly celebrating in the streets.

In the Red Sea-flanked city of Port Sudan, boisterous crowds waved the Sudanese flag in celebration, verified videos also showed, following the news that the strategic city had been taken from the RSF’s control.

In Omdurman, chants of “one army, one people” broke out, an eyewitness told the AFP news agency.

New wave of mass killings in Sudan alarms UN

27 October 2024 Share Save Farouk Chothia BBC News Share Save

Getty Images Escalating conflict in Sudan's Gezira state has forced civilians to flee

A senior UN official in Sudan says she is deeply troubled by reports of "atrocious crimes" in the central Gezira state, including the mass killing of civilians by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Clementine Nkweta-Salami's comments came after an activist group said that at least 124 people were killed by the RSF in attacks on villages over the past week. The RSF has denied targeting civilians, saying its fighters are clashing with militias armed by the military. The 18-month conflict in Sudan has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced more than 11 million.

Gezira state turned into a major battleground last week after the RSF suffered a major blow when one of its commanders, Abu Aqla Kayka, defected to the military. The army said he had brought "a large number of his forces" with him, in what it described as the first high-profile defection to its side. In response, the RSF said its fighters would defend themselves and "decisively deal with everyone carrying arms".

Ms Nkweta-Salami, the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, said that preliminary reports suggested that the RSF had carried out a major attack across the state between 20 and 25 October. She added that it led to mass killings, the raping of women and girls, the widespread looting of markets and homes and the burning down of farms. Ms Nkweta-Salami said the "atrocious crimes" were on a scale similar to those seen in Sudan's Darfur region last year, when the RSF was accused of "ethnic cleansing" communities seen to be opposed to it. Ms Nkweta-Salami said the death toll was still unclear, but preliminary reports suggested that scores of people were killed in Gezira state. In a statement on Saturday, the Wad Madani Resistance Committee, which campaigns for an end to the conflict and democratic rule in Sudan, said the RSF was committing "extensive massacres in one village after another", the Reuters news agency reported. The Sudanese doctors' union called on the UN to push the two sides in the conflict to agree to safe humanitarian corridors into villages that were facing "genocide" at the hands of the RSF. The doctors' union added that rescue operations had become impossible and that the army was "incapable" of protecting civilians. The conflict in Sudan broke out in April 2023 after a fall out between the commanders of the RSF and military, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo and Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan respectively. The two had jointly staged a coup in 2021, derailing Sudan's transition to democracy, but then got involved in a vicious power struggle. The two leaders have refused to sign a peace deal, despite efforts by the US and Saudi Arabia to broker an end to the conflict.

United Nations — As the Sudanese Civil War continues to ravage the people of Sudan, conditions for internally displaced persons grow more dire every day. The situation in Sudan is currently the biggest displacement crisis in the world. Famine, violence, and gender-based violence are rampant. Described as "an invisible crisis" by the United Nations (UN) new emergency relief chief, Tom Fletcher, many believe that the humanitarian response has been largely ineffective in tackling the urgent and growing scale of needs.

The latest figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimate that approximately 11.5 million people have fled their homes since the wake of the war. Roughly 8.5 million people have been dispersed throughout Sudan's borders while 3 million have fled to neighbouring nations such as Chad, Egypt, and Ethiopia. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) mass displacement has given way to one of the world's biggest educational crises. It is estimated that 90 percent of Sudan's 19 million school-aged children lack access to any form of formal education.

Sudanese displacement camps have seen a steep rise of violence over the past few days. On December 1-2, intense gunfire and shelling was reported around the Zamzam camp, one of Sudan's largest shelters, located south of El Fasher, North Darfur. According to humanitarian organizations, at least five people were killed and eighteen were injured. This led to the evacuation of a hospital within the camp and suspension of medical services.

In a report released by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami condemned the attack and urged for stronger protections to be established for civilians.

"I am deeply concerned by reports of the indiscriminate shelling of Zamzam camp, health clinics, and shelters of displaced people. Their protection is paramount. Civilians and civilian infrastructure are protected under international humanitarian law and should never be a target," said Nkweta-Salami.

The UN has described conditions in the Zamzam camp as being at a "breaking point." Heightened violence has exacerbated already dire conditions for the nearly 500,000 displaced persons residing in this camp. Health clinics, residential areas, and the humanitarian response has been severely strained due to the sheer scale of suffering. According to a press release from the UN, famine has been persistent in the Zamzam camp since August 2024, making it the only location globally where famine has been declared this year.

The medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders, also known as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), has been on the frontlines assisting displaced persons facing severe injuries or war-related conditions. On December 1, MSF received eight injured people, including children as young as four years old. These patients faced conditions such as chest trauma and bone fractures.

MSF reports that thousands of children are currently being treated for malnutrition and starvation. A series of studies were conducted to assess the mortality rate of 400 households in the Zamzam camp. Out of 46,000 children, it is reported that approximately 30 percent are struggling with acute malnutrition, while 8 percent are facing severe malnutrition. Furthermore, 10 percent of children under five years old struggle with severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening condition.

The World Food Programme has called for a cessation in violence to allow humanitarian aid to reach affected communities. "We've been pushing for months to get to these communities. We have the food. We have the trucks. We have the staff on board to ensure this aid gets there. Now, we need all warring parties and armed groups to allow this vital food and nutrition to arrive safely," said Alex Marianelli, WFP's Operations Deputy Country Director in Sudan.

Additionally, gender-based violence remains a pervasive issue plaguing displaced communities all across Sudan. According to statistics from the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), approximately 65 percent of all women and girls experience sexual, physical, and gender-based violence in their lifetime. Sudan also ranks as one of the nations with the highest number of reported cases of intimate partner violence.

"Every day countless South Sudanese women and girls endure unthinkable suffering due to gender-based violence and conflict-related sexual violence," said South Sudanese Minister of Gender, Child and Social Welfare Aya Warille. "These acts are more than mere statistics. They are profound violations of human rights that fracture the very fabric of our society. They rob our mothers, sisters and daughters of their dignity and place an immense burden on our future. This is not just a women issue, it is a societal crisis that speaks to the core of our humanity."

Sudanese civilians and humanitarian officials have described aid efforts as being inadequate, relative to the massive, nationwide scale of suffering. Twenty years ago, we had presidents and prime ministers engaged to stop atrocities in Darfur. There are today many times as many lives at stake - this is the world's worst crisis -- but we are met with deafening silence. We must wake up the world before famine engulfs a generation of children," said Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) Secretary General Jan Egeland.

Despite many believing that Sudan has been largely "ignored" by the international community, the UN reiterates that Sudan is a pressing concern for them. "This crisis is not invisible to the UN, to our humanitarians on the front-line risking and losing their lives to help the Sudanese people," said Fletcher.

Reasons for the limited humanitarian response can be attributed to widespread social insecurity that has been exacerbated by violence and an overall lack of funding. Mobility and aid deliveries have experienced increasingly common restrictions and blockages. Additionally, the UN's goal of 2.7 billion USD for the humanitarian response in Sudan has only been 57 percent funded. This poses significant challenges in sustaining life-saving aid efforts in the face of a crisis that deepens in severity on a daily basis.

Sudan in danger of becoming a failed state, aid chief warns

Millions of people have been forced to flee their homes in Sudan

For nineteen months, there has been a brutal power struggle between the army and the RSF, that has forced over 10 million people to flee their homes and pushed the country to the brink of starvation.

"The parties are tearing down their own houses, they are massacring their own people," he said.

As well as the two main warring parties in Sudan - the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces - there are many smaller "ethnic armies" looting and going "berserk" on civilians, Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), said.

War-stricken Sudan is in danger of becoming another failed state because civil society is disintegrating amid a proliferation of armed groups, the head of a leading international aid agency has told the BBC.

"All that I saw confirms that this is indeed the biggest humanitarian emergency on our watch, the biggest hunger crisis, the biggest displacement crisis," Mr Egeland said, following a trip to Sudan.

In September, the World Health Organization (WHO) said starvation in Sudan "is almost everywhere".

Soup kitchens have been forced to close due to being underfunded. Egeland said the lack of humanitarian response meant remaining sources of aid are simply "delaying deaths instead of preventing them.”

"Most of Sudan is starving, it's starving," he said, adding that starvation has been used as a method of warfare.

Some food security specialists fear that as many as 2.5 million people could die from hunger by the end of this year.

Mr Egeland warned that the world is "failing Sudan completely" by not doing enough.

He told the BBC if Europe wanted to avoid a refugee crisis, it needed to invest in "aid, protection and peace in this corner of the world".

"It's an underfunded operation, even though it's the world's biggest emergency," he said.

Thousands of people have been killed since a civil war broke out. Rights groups have also expressed fears that there may be ethnic cleansing and genocide in Sudan.

Despite this, peace talks between the RSF and the army have been fruitless.

"The war will stop when these warlords feel they have more to lose by continuing fighting, than by doing the sensible thing" Egeland said.

El Fasher / Zamzam Camp — New satellite imagery by the Yale University Humanitarian Research Centre reveals the scale of destruction inflicted by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) attack on Zamzam camp, which houses between 500,000 and 1 million people. The UN, Save the Children, and MSF have all called for urgent international action to de-escalate the situation.

Zamzam camp, housing displaced people near El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, endured heavy shelling on December 1 and 2, leaving at least five people dead and 18 injured, including children.

The Yale University Humanitarian Research Centre released satellite imagery on Tuesday showing significant damage in the camp between December 1 and 3. Photos revealed destroyed buildings, smoke from munitions, and a large crater outside a camp for displaced people.

"The damaged locations are spread out over a large area, which may be consistent with indiscriminate fire disproportionately impacting civilians", according to the report.

The research centre noted that the residents of Zamzam camp "appear to have deconstructed temporary shelters, likely in advance of departure, and additional temporary shelters consistent with [displaced people] are newly present outside Zamzam".

According to journalist Moamer Ibrahim, RSF continues to target critical areas, "including the livestock market and residential neighbourhoods". He added that the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Sudanese Joint Forces* have resisted RSF advances on multiple fronts.

The RSF has denied responsibility for the attack.

Local political groups and humanitarian organisations have previously raised concerns about the militarisation of displacement camps. In October, 46 organisations issued a joint statement warning that the presence of military forces in Zamzam camp endangers civilians and urged an end to military operations within displacement camps. Satellite analysis by Yale's Humanitarian Research Centre in November also identified new defensive structures near the camp.

Condemnations

International figures have condemned the violence. Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan, described the situation as "unacceptable" and called for the protection of civilians.

"It is now 232 days since the siege of El Fasher began, which has resulted in unacceptable levels of human suffering", Nkweta-Salami said in a statement Tuesday. She expressed her alarm that NGOs operating in the camp have been forced to suspend their activities, and the camp hospital has been evacuated.

Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF/Doctors Without Borders) reported earlier this week that the violence forced it to evacuate its hospital in Zamzam, transferring patients and medical staff to safer locations. "We're concerned about their safety, including our staff, and we urgently call for the protection of patients, civilians, medical teams and health facilities, in Zamzam camp."

Michel-Olivier Lacharité, MSF's head of emergency operations, said: "Not only have people been starving, but they are also now being bombarded and forced to flee again."

Famine

Save the Children echoed these concerns, citing rising cases of severe malnutrition, manifesting as emaciation, swelling, and skin discolouration in Zamzam camp, which they described as "the safest place in North Darfur for families and children" up until the attack on Sunday. Interim country director Mohamed Abdellatif called the situation "beyond comprehension."

According to a Save the Children statement published earlier this week, families are resorting to consuming animal feed (ambaz), which exists of the remains of beans and sesame after oil extraction. Water scarcity has meant that camp residents are receiving just two litres of water per person daily--far below the required 20 litres.

Famine conditions, classified as Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Phase 5, the highest level on the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale, were confirmed in July at Zamzam camp, leaving thousands of children facing life-threatening malnutrition.

Paramilitary RSF fighters have again brutally massacred scores of civilians, with Sudan's army also escalating attacks. Peace continues to be elusive.

Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, has rampaged through several towns in Gezira state, south of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.

The fighters from the notorious paramilitary brutally killed at least 120 civilians in a multiday attack, according to diverse media reports and the United Nations. Other sources, however, have spoken of hundreds of civilian casualties in the past few days.

Scores of people were injured and more than 47,000 displaced in these latest attacks, according to the UN humanitarian office, known as OCHA.

The latest massacre is a continuation of the brutality of the war that broke out in April 2023 when tensions between Sudan's army, the SAF, and the RSF exploded into open fighting.

Since then, almost 25,000 people have been killed, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data group which has been monitoring the conflict since it started.

In a report released on Wednesday, a UN fact-finding mission documented large-scale sexual violence in areas under RSF control and said there were reasonable grounds to believe these acts amounted to war crimes.

The humanitarian situation in the country is considered catastrophic.

Retaliation for defecting fighters

Observers have pointed to the defection of Abu Aqla Keikel, a former RSF commander in Gezira state, as the trigger for these retaliatory attacks.

Keikel reportedly switched sides on October 20 when he and his troops defected to the SAF.

But the RSF violence was not only directed against the defectors but also against the communities in the eastern part of the province where Keikel hails from.

"Kill a young Keikel before he grows up," the RSF fighters are said to have chanted, among other slogans calling for the extermination of what they called "traitors," according to a report by the Sudanese NGO Fikra for Studies and Development .

Fikra said the paramilitary group killed 300 people in the city of Tamboul on a single day, October 22, after launching a similar attack on Rufaa the day before, "resulting in 100 deaths, rape of women, and numerous cases of kidnapping and disappearance of girls."

Some 100 other villages in the east Gezira were raided in the multiday rampage, Fikra reported.

RSF fighters are underage, heavily drugged

"Such violence is unfortunately not new in itself," Marina Peter, chair of the German-based Sudan and South Sudan Forum, told DW.

Comparable atrocities occurred in the first Darfur war in the early 2000s, she said.

"At that time, too, there was terrible brutality, people were burned to death, fugitives were shot, civilians were tortured, and women were raped en masse," she said.

That the RSF fighters are young and heavily drugged adds to the brutality, Peter said. "Some of them are child soldiers and completely uninhibited by the drugs," she said.

According to Ahmed Esam, an activist at the NGO Sudan Uprising Germany, the RFS massacres aren't just about seizing land and agriculture.

"Rather, it is about intimidating civil society, which, despite war and violence, continues to advocate the original concerns of the protest movement which is the transition from a military to a civilian government in Sudan," he told DW.

The protest movement that began in 2018 led to the ouster of longtime authoritarian president Omar al-Bashir in 2019, but a coup in 2021 saw the military seize power.

In addition, the RSF is pursuing the strategic goal of preventing civilians from joining the Popular Defense Forces, or PDF, a paramilitary group that fights alongside the army against the RSF militias, he said.

Army 'trying to outsource the war to third parties'

But Esam also sees the army as playing a big part in the high civilian death toll in Sudan. The mere founding of the PDF is irresponsible and sheds a telling light on the army's actions, he said.

"The army is mobilizing civilians without offering them adequate protection," he said. "They hand them weapons and tell them to defend themselves against the RSF forces, but they have no chance against experienced militias and when the RSF forces attack the civilians, the army does nothing to protect them," he said.

The Sudanese army is also extremely brutal, said Esam. "The military primarily uses its air force which is not equipped with precision weapons," he said, adding that this is one reason why so many civilians die in the attacks.

As he sees it, the army "is trying to outsource the war to third parties, especially to the civilians, who have absolutely no experience with it," which is also contributing to the rising death toll.

This view is echoed by Peter, who sees more and more groups "getting involved in the war."

Ethnic militias, Islamist militias from the circle of former dictator al-Bashir, and militias with links to Sudan's secret service, are increasingly fighting on the front lines.

"The war is becoming ever more confusing, and this means that the chances of ending it are dwindling," she said.

Cease-fire remains unlikely

In an October briefing paper, the International Crisis Group, an independent organization working to prevent conflict, warned that "rebel groups from neighboring countries could increase their support to the belligerents."

In consequence, "the conflict's expansion could extend violence into neighboring countries by involving cross-border armed groups. ... Embroiling more actors in the turmoil risks exacerbating hostilities."

For the time being, the Crisis Group experts also remain skeptical about international mediation given that the conflict parties are receiving strong external support from regional actors, including Arab states and Russia.

El Zurug / El Fasher / Zamzam Camp / Abu Zereiga — Sudan's Joint Forces, a coalition of armed movements aligned with the Sudanese Armed Forces, announced the capture of El Zurug, a major paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) stronghold in North Darfur. The operation, which took place on Saturday, reportedly targeted a key military base housing six garrisons. Fierce battles lasting over five hours culminated in the joint force claiming victory, according to reports obtained by Radio Dabanga.

El Zurug, located near the Sudanese-Libyan-Chadian border triangle, holds immense strategic importance as a vital route for smuggling operations and military logistics. The RSF has reportedly used the area since 2017 to build a military stronghold, forcibly displacing over 140,000 residents to consolidate control.

Maj Ahmed Hussein, spokesperson for the joint forces, detailed the scale of the operation, revealing that El Zurug's military base and airport, along with four other bases, had been seized. He alleged that these facilities served as critical hubs for smuggling weapons and personnel into Sudan and functioned as RSF supply routes. Hussein also reported the confiscation of significant quantities of fuel, weapons, and ammunition.

Darfur Governor Minni Arko Minawi supported the operation, stating in a post on X that it was a response to RSF attacks targeting El Fasher, Zamzam Camp, and Abu Zereiga. Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim, leader of the Justice and Equality Movement, described El Zurug as the RSF's "most important stronghold" in North Darfur and praised the joint force's success.

The RSF countered on Sunday, claiming they had regained control of El Zurug following a dawn assault. In a statement, the RSF accused the joint forces of committing atrocities, including ethnic cleansing and the deliberate killing of women, children, and the elderly.

According to the paramilitary group, they also alleged that civilian infrastructure, including homes, markets, and water wells, had been deliberately destroyed. Video footage released by the RSF purportedly showed extensive damage, including burnt-out markets and homes.

The joint forces dismissed these allegations. Julius Issawi, a member of its information committee, described the RSF's accusations as baseless propaganda designed to manipulate public opinion. He emphasised that the El Zurug base was a legitimate military target, asserting that civilians were not present at the site.

On Sunday, the joint forces shared videos allegedly showing their members inspecting captured RSF weapons and facilities, including abandoned bases.

El Basha Tebeig, advisor to RSF Commander Mohamed 'Hemedti' Dagalo, dismissed the footage as misleading and urged supporters to ignore what it called "false narratives."

*The Sudanese Joint Force is made up of fighters of the Sudan Liberation Movement faction headed by Darfur Governor Minni Minawi (SLM-MM), the JEM faction led by Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim (JEM-JI), and several small rebel groups. These movements formed the Darfur Joint Force in June 2022 as agreed in the 2020 Juba Peace Agreement, to protect the people of Darfur. They renounced their neutrality in November last year and are now fighting against the RSF alongside the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF).

The Sudanese army and the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces traded airstrikes that led to the loss of over 100 civilian lives. Famine has also been declared in a refugee camp in North Darfur.

At least 127 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Sudan as the army and paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) traded barrel bombs and shelling across the country.

In the city of Omdurman, paramilitary shelling on Tuesday was said to have killed at least 65 people, according to the state's army-aligned governor.

The attack came a day after an army airstrike on a market in the North Darfur town of Kabkabiya killed over 100 people, pro-democracy group Emergency Lawyers said.

The two sides have been fighting each other since April 2023,with civilian areas indiscriminately targeted by both groups as ceasefire efforts have stalled.

What have the Sudan army and RSF said?

According to the AFP news agency, the governor of Khartoum, Ahmed Othman Hamza, said a single shell fired by the RSF struck a passenger bus and "killed everyone on board and turned 22 people into body parts."

Meanwhile, according to the pro-democracy Al-Fashir Resistance Committee, eight barrel bombs hit a market in Kabkabiya.

"The airstrike took place on the town's weekly market day where residents from various nearby villages had gathered to shop," Emergency Lawyers said of the strikes. "It resulted in the death of more than 100 people and injury of hundreds, including women and children."

The army currently controls parts of the capital, as well as the country's north and east and has frequently targeted towns in North Darfur with airstrikes.

They are fighting the RSF for control of the North Darfur state capital, al-Fashir, its last foothold in the region.

Responding to the most recent attack on Kabkabiya, the army denied responsibility and insisted it had the right to target any location used by the RSF for military purposes.

The RSF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Millions of civilians facing famine

The 20-month war between the army and the RSF has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced 12 million. It has destroyed most of Khartoum, with both sides battling to claim control of the area.

The United Nations has said the war has created the worst humanitarian crisis in recent memory, with famine having been declared in the Zamzam refugee camp in North Darfur, which saw shelling on Tuesday killed seven people living in the camp.

Over 680,000 Sudanese refugees have found safety in Chad, forced to flee the war raging back home.

In the last month alone, 60,000 new refugees arrived; the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said this week.

The vast majority of the new arrivals are women and children, many reach the border after walking for long distances before entering to neighbouring Chad.

“We had nothing to eat at home, part of my house was also burnt down. Before we left, seven people were killed in front of our house. Nights have always been terrifying for us, there are so many people who have been killed. “I lost all my precious possessions. Initially, we didn’t live in El-Geneina. We were a few kilometres from El-Geneina where we kept cattle, goats, and poultry. We have lost everything.”

However, suffering doesn't end in Chad. Refugees arrive in a country with limited resources. Chad is facing the greatest refugee influx in its history, according to the United Nations.

The country's weak economy and poor infrastructure is grappling with a mix of conflict, climate crisis, and food insecurity.

In a context of "non-stop humanitarian emergencies, of insufficient humanitarian funding, and where displacement is increasingly protracted in time with host community increasingly affected, we need to rethink our approaches to refugee displacement to make them more sustainable," Filippo Grandi said.

Residents in war-torn Sudan, where the conflict is approaching its two-year anniversary, are also grappling with the effects of climate change.

Among them is peace and climate activist Nisreen Elsaim, who was driven from her home that was situated in an area affected by the violence as well as flooding.

“The morning of Saturday, 15th of April 2023 was a very normal morning until we heard a very big explosion to the point that our whole house was shaking. And then, unfortunately, these explosions and sounds never stopped. And basically, until now, it's over 600 days since the war started in Sudan. We stayed in our house for three weeks, and then we started getting out of running out of food and water and electricity. And then moving out was a must,” Elsaim says.

According to Elsaim, those hit the hardest by climate change were the most vulnerable, including the millions displaced by the fighting.

“The war in Sudan caused more than 12 million refugees and IDPs,” Elsaim notes.

“The biggest number of IDPs were concentrated in these states where it was flooded. The total area that was flooded is bigger than Germany in its size and definitely had a lot of the camps inside of it. Currently, Sudan is living the biggest humanitarian crisis ever,'' she adds.

She's calling for more humanitarian aid, and for aid to be adapted to withstand the effects of extreme weather.

“We must consider climate change when we are planning for humanitarian interventions. Making climate sensitive humanitarian is not a privilege right now. It's a key and it's a must, basically. Otherwise, all of our humanitarian efforts will just flood with the water,'' Elsaim insists.

With regular droughts and significant variations in rainfall, Sudan is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, according to the UN.

The conflict between the Sudanese Army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces broke out in April 2023; since then, at least 20,000 have been killed.

Sudan's Sovereign Council leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, has declared that a return to the pre-conflict status with the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF) is off the table.

Speaking on the country's 69th independence anniversary, al-Burhan called the RSF "murderers and criminals" and ruled out any reintegration of the group into Sudanese society.

“There is no going back to the situation before April 15, 2023, nor can we accept the presence of these criminals among Sudanese people,” he said in a televised address aired on Sudanese state television Tuesday.

While rejecting reconciliation with the RSF, al-Burhan expressed willingness to engage in peace initiatives aimed at ending the conflict and ensuring the safe return of civilians displaced by the war.

A Country in Crisis

Since clashes began in April 2023 between Sudan's military, led by al-Burhan, and the RSF, commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the humanitarian toll has been devastating. The violence has claimed nearly 25,000 lives and displaced over 10 million people, according to the United Nations.

The fighting has engulfed 13 of Sudan’s 18 states, triggering massive destruction, famine, and violations against civilians. Mediation efforts led by the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have so far failed to secure a lasting ceasefire, with both parties accusing each other of sabotaging peace negotiations.

Sudan remains in the grip of violence, with millions of lives at risk and little hope for immediate resolution.

Omar al-Bashir: How Sudan's military strongmen stayed in power

11 April 2019 Share Save Share Save

AFP The military authorities want to avoid rival security forces clashing in the capital

Thursday's coup in Sudan may have seen the overthrow of an unpopular president but those close to Omar al-Bashir are determined to stay in power, writes Sudan expert Alex de Waal.

For the first time in almost 30 years, Sudan is not ruled by President Omar al-Bashir.

But when Sudanese listened to Lt Gen Awad Ibn Auf announcing a transitional military council, they would have heard his master's voice.

Gen Ibn Auf is a career soldier, cut from the same cloth as Mr Bashir. He was head of military intelligence during the conflict and atrocities in Darfur, for which he was put on a US list for targeted financial sanctions.

AFP There was no mention of the involvement of civilians in the two-year transition

He was defence minister and after President Bashir declared a state of emergency on 22 February, Gen Ibn Auf was also promoted to serve as vice-president, with the implication that he would step into the president's shoes when the his constitutional term expired in April 2020.

The trigger for the removal of Mr Bashir was a five-day round-the-clock peaceful protest in which tens of thousands of people surrounded the army headquarters in Khartoum, demanding that the president step down.

Leaders haggling

But what happened next was determined by hard bargaining within those buildings, among the military oligarchs who sat just beneath the president in the security hierarchy.

During the course of Thursday, there was a protracted silence from the military headquarters while Gen Ibn Auf, the senior commanders of the Sudan Armed Forces and other key security figures such as Gen Salah Abdalla Gosh, head of the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), haggled over the political dispensation that would follow Mr Bashir's removal.

Omar al-Bashir at a glance:

AFP

Fights in Egyptian army in 1973 Arab-Israeli war

Seizes power in Sudan in 1989 in an Islamist-backed coup

Gives asylum to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in 1990s

First head of state indicted by ICC in 2009, but denies accusations of war crimes in Darfur

Makes peace with southern rebels in 2005

Oversees secession of the south in 2011, leading to Sudan losing three-quarters of its oil wealth

Ousted by military in April 2019

Little is known about his private life. He has no children

When Gen Ibn Auf finally addressed the nation, he announced the removal of President Bashir, the abolition of the constitution, the formation of a transitional military council, a state of emergency and a two-year transition. But he did not invite opposition representatives into government. In fact, he did not even offer to talk to them.

The details of the pact among the security cabal are not public. But the outline is clear.

Avoiding street bloodshed

First, the army, NISS and the paramilitary leaders (such as Mohamed Hamdan "Hemeti", commander of the Rapid Support Forces) want to share power among themselves.

They want to avoid a repeat of clashes that occurred earlier in the week, when army units fired on NISS militiamen who were trying to disperse the crowd of protesters by force, let alone an internecine war on the streets of the capital.

Second, the cabal is aligned with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, Qatar and Turkey have lost out.

The new leadership dissolved the ruling National Congress Party (NCP) and reportedly arrested many veteran Muslim Brothers.

AFP President Omar al-Bashir (centre) came to power after a coup in 1989

They are busy telling Western countries that the Islamists had planned a coup, which needed to be forestalled by the army takeover, and that the protesters demanding democracy are also Muslim Brothers in disguise. It's not a very convincing story, but it points to future tensions because the Islamists still have a strong following in Sudan.

Third, the coup leaders will protect the ousted president, even while they blame him publicly for the country's ills.

The official announcement spoke of him being kept in a "safe place". They will not hand him over to the International Criminal Court, where he is wanted for crimes in relation to the Darfur conflict. Partly this is because they are no less responsible than Mr Bashir for the atrocities in Darfur and elsewhere.

It is also because that they know that one of his biggest assets was his reputation for loyalty to the officer corps, and they hope that some of that legacy will rub off on them. Keeping the current security coalition intact will be impossible if any one of them starts fearing he may be handed to a foreign power or court.

And fourth, they have not decided how to handle the challenge posed by the demonstrators, who are still massed on the streets.

A woman dubbed 'Kandaka', which means Nubian queen, has become a symbol for protesters

Gen Ibn Auf and his collaborators cannot have been so naïve as to assume that their gambit would satisfy the opposition. Rather, they are buying time so that they can decide whether to follow the path of repression or co-option, or more likely a bit of both.

Sudan has taken one step back from the precipice of bloodshed on the streets of the capital, but only one. If the 11 April coup turns out to be a step towards democracy, it will be despite what the coup makers wanted, not because of them.

With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the Wayback Machine, providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

The Archive Team Panic Downloads are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

The attacks in the north and east of Gezira state have been called a massacre by the Gezira Conference, a local civil society organization.

It said fighters belonging to the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) stormed a town in the Al-Kamelin locality on Friday morning and began firing indiscriminately from high-rise buildings. At least 50 people were killed and hundreds more injured.

In the the city of Tamboul in Gezira's north, RSF fighters went on rampage, killing dozens of civilians and displacing thousands of others.

Local groups say the attacks appear to be motivated by rage after a top RSF commander defected to the army side. Abu Aqlah Keikel, the de facto ruler of Gezira province surrendered to the Sudanese military in early October. Keikel hails from Gezira state.

The Doctors' Union in Sudan has said that RSF attacks turned areas in eastern Gezira into “a brutal war zone.”

It accused the fighters of committing sexual crimes, attacks on health facilities and forced displacement.

'Forgotten crisis'

A senior United Nations official on Friday called for more international attention to “the forgotten crisis” in Sudan, where more than a year and a half of war pushed the African country to the brink of famine.

The appeal by Ted Chaiban, deputy head of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, came as the notorious paramilitary Rapid Support Forces rampaged through villages and towns in east-central Gezira province, looting and vandalizing public and private properties, according to a doctors’ union and a youth group. Dozens of people were reported killed.

Chaiban said the war, which erupted in April 2023 between the military and the RSF, created “one of the most acute crises in living memory” with more than 14 million people forced to flee their homes, making Sudan the world’s largest displacement crisis.

“We’ve never in a generation seen these types of numbers,” he told The Associated Press in an interview, referring to the displaced people, as well as the 8.5 million people who are facing emergency levels of food insecurity, and 775,000 others who are facing famine-like conditions.

“The whole country has been dislocated,” he said. “And yet, despite that, the country and the crisis is forgotten.”

The recapture of the Sudanese city of Wad Medani came over a year after it fell to the RSF paramilitary force. Just days earlier, the Biden administration accused the rebels of genocide.

Sudan's military and its allies have recaptured the strategic city of Wad Madani from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), officials said Saturday.

"The leadership of the Armed Forces congratulates our people on the entry of our forces into Wad Madani this morning. They are now working to clean up the remaining rebel pockets inside the city," the army said in a statement.

RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Daglo acknowledged defeat but pledged to "regain" Wad Madani in an audio message to his fighters and the Sudanese people on Saturday evening.

"Today we lost a round, we did not lose the battle," Daglo said.

Why is Wad Medani important?

Wad Madani, the capital of Gezira State, in central Sudan, holds strategic importance as it is at the crossroads of major trade routes.

It is also the closest major town to the capital. The city lies about 170 kilometers (105 miles) southeast of Khartoum.

In the early months of the war, Wad Medani served as a refuge for displaced families.

The recapture of Wad Medani came more than a year after it fell to the RSF in October 2023.

The recapture of the state as a whole could mark a turning point in the war that began in April 2023.

Civil war in Sudan

The war has left tens of thousands of people dead and displaced millions, while leaving more than 30 million in urgent need of aid.

The UN calls the conflict the world's worst displacement crisis, with famine officially declared in parts of the northeast African country.

Earlier this month, the Biden administration accused the RSF and allied militias of committing genocide.

The RSF can trace its origins to the Janjaweed militias, which former autocrat Omar al-Bashir heavily relied on to quell a 2003 uprising in Darfur.

The RSF and the Sudanese army had shared power with civilians after the 2019 overthrow of al-Bashir before staging a coup together in 2021 then coming to blows over an internationally backed political transition plan.
