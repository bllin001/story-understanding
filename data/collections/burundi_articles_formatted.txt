Asha, a mother-of-four, found herself once again donning rubber boots inside her living room – the recurring cost of residing near Lake Tanganyika in Burundi, where climate change and relentless flooding have become a part of daily life.

The graceful architecture of Gatumba – a town bordering the capital, Bujumbura – serves as a testament to its past prosperity. Yet for many, that memory feels remote.

Increasingly, residents resort to pitching tents atop their roofs, as children drift between homes on makeshift rafts fashioned from plastic bottles.

“We’ve been underwater for years,” said Asha, aged 32.

Lake Tanganyika is known for its cyclical fluctuations in water level, but these have been worsened by global warming, according to Bernard Sindayihebura, an urban planning and environment specialist at the University of Burundi.

He explained that surface temperatures on Africa’s second-largest lake have climbed steadily, leading to heavier rainfall and pushing the lake above its historical average since 2018.

With the lake swollen, the Ruzizi River is unable to drain into it, resulting in persistent floods that inundate surrounding areas like Gatumba on the northern shore.

The situation escalated in 2023, when Asha and her family were forced to flee a particularly severe flood. With water rising as high as her waist, she had to seek shelter in temporary accommodation nearby.

The following year, and again this year, they were displaced repeatedly, as floodwaters engulfed entire neighbourhoods.

Burundi ranks among the world’s poorest nations, standing 187th out of 193 on the United Nations Human Development Index. The UN also lists it as one of the 20 countries most vulnerable to climate change.

In 2024, pounding rains, magnified by the El Nino phenomenon, displaced nearly 100,000 people and claimed numerous lives, although no official figures have been released.

Ariella, a mother of seven now residing in the Gateri camp for internally displaced people (IDP) in northern Burundi, spoke of losing everything in the 2020 Gatumba floods.

Her house collapsed, and one of her babies was almost swept away by the floodwaters. The family moved between two different camps, only to be hit by floods again.

“We often wonder what our future will look like,” said Ariella.

In Gatumba, community leader Jean-Marie Niyonkuru, 42, said residents are doing their best to cope, but conditions remain dire.

“Children suffer from diarrhoea because the water has mixed with toilet water, flooding the streets,” he said. “There is a lot of cholera.”

Save the Children is now appealing for assistance, but critical funding has dried up. Under President Donald Trump, 83 percent of United States humanitarian projects have been suspended, with climate-related programmes among those most at risk.

The US previously provided 40 percent of global aid, and no other country has bridged the gap.

Burundi is heading to the polls in a tightly controlled vote expected to favor the ruling party. The opposition has been blocked as the country faces deepening economic crisis.

Voters in Burundi went to the polls to vote for a new parliament on Thursday, with the outcome almost predetermined after the main opposition was effectively blocked from competing.

The ruling National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) party, led by President Evariste Ndayishimiye, faces little electoral threat after a series of moves neutralized its primary rival, the National Freedom Council (CNL).

What do we know about the Burundi election?

The CNL, which placed second in the 2020 election amid alleged widespread fraud, was suspended in 2023 by the Interior Ministry over alleged "irregularities" in how it held meetings.

Later that year, while party leader Agathon Rwasa was abroad, the CNL ousted him in a move widely seen as orchestrated by the government.

He was replaced by Nestor Girukwishaka — a former minister and executive at a state-owned company with close ties to the ruling party — prompting accusations of a government-backed internal coup.

Rwasa and his allies have since been barred from joining other opposition groups or standing as independents, effectively shutting them out of Thursday's vote.

One Burundian political analyst, speaking anonymouslyto the AFP news agency because of security fears, told the CNDD-FDD was leaving nothing to chance amid "a very deep socio-economic crisis."

Burundi, a former German colony, faces poverty and economic crisis

The country, already one of the poorest in the world, is grappling with widespread shortages, soaring inflation—reportedly exceeding 40% monthly—and rising public anger.

Burundi, a former German colony, has a long history of ethnic conflict, civil war, and authoritarian rule.

Thursday's vote, observers say, will likely reinforce the ruling party's grip on power as it faces mounting internal pressure over economic mismanagement and political repression.

Government denies claims it is sending armed agents to UN-run refugee camps to kidnap and kill opposition supporters.

Refugees from Burundi, who fled violence in their country to neighbouring Tanzania, have accused their government of sending armed men into a UN-run refugee camp to hunt down opposition supporters.

Several refugees have told Al Jazeera that they fear for their lives and that there is no adequate security in the camps in Tanzania to protect them.

“The camp is currently not safe. We live in fear of Burundian government militia [members] who are in the camp,” one refugee said in a phone interview, after Al Jazeera visited a camp in north west Tanzania.

The Burundian government has denied the allegations.

More than 200,000 people have fled Burundi since the African country slipped into a violent political crisis, and half of the refugees have sought shelter in Tanzania.

Al Jazeera visited the Nduta camp, where over 40,000 refugees are currently staying.

But the team was only allowed to interview refugees who had been screened by officials from the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR. The UN said the screening was for the protection of refugees.

However, other refugees in the camp who later spoke to Al Jazeera by phone said Burundi had dispatched agents who carried out attempted killings and abductions.

One man told Al Jazeera that he narrowly escaped an abduction.

“Some of our group were tied up. We were loaded onto a truck and driven away. My friend and I jumped off and ran away to the Tanzanian border, where we met more government militia. They killed my friend but I escaped over the border,” he said.

Several other refugees also said dozens of Burundians had left the camp in November in the belief they would join an armed rebel group back in Burundi.

The refugees said they later learned it was a trap set by government-backed armed groups, and that most members of the group were killed, according to reports from people inside Burundi.

The refugees said they reported the incidents to camp officials, but most of the government agents are still at large.

Burundi’s denial

Contesting the refugees’ accounts, Alain Nyamitwe, the Burundian foreign minister, told Al Jazeera the allegations were baseless.

“I don’t believe that there are militia operating in Tanzania as we have heard [from] UNHCR authorities,” he said.

“In any case, anything beyond the borders of Burundi is not the responsibility of the government of Burundi.”

The Tanzanian government, for its part, said it was not aware of the allegations, but that it would do whatever it could to secure the camps.

“The government has been very strict, and whenever we have spotted any kind of activity that is trying to suggest there is any kind of recruitment, we have actually taken serious measures,” Harrison Mseke, Tanzanian director of refugees, told Al Jazeera.

“Only last week some refugees were actually apprehended and they were taken before the courts and charged on issues that were associated.”

Burundi has been plunged into violence since last year, after President Pierre Nkurunziza won a controversial third term, prompting street protests, a failed coup and sectarian killings.

A leaked UN report has accused the neighbouring Rwandan government of recruiting and training Burundian refugees in a camp in Rwanda to fight against the Burundian government.

Rwanda has denied the allegations.

Unlike acute malnutrition, which happens quickly and requires immediate treatment to prevent death, chronic malnutrition occurs over the long term. Its main consequence is stunting, which “​​holds children back from reaching their physical and cognitive potential,” according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and is one of the challenges facing certain countries, including Burundi.

“Acute malnutrition seems to be under control in Burundi, at a rate of around 4.8%.The challenge remains stunting,” as confirmed by Doctor Célestin Sibomana, Permanent Executive Secretary of the Multisectoral Food and Nutrition Security Platform, Office of the Prime Minister.

The latest nutritional survey conducted in Burundi (SMART, 2022) showed that 56% of children under the age of 5 suffer from stunting, which is well above the critical threshold of 30% set by the WHO. Beyond the nutritional emergency, the consequences can be seen over the long term, with “socio-emotional and neurophysiological development problems that may lead to harmful effects on health, learning, future productivity and on the economy of their communities and their nations,” explains France Bégin, UNICEF Representative in Burundi.

Burundi has already realised that stunting is a complex problem with many causes: on the one hand, the low standard of living for households does not allow access to sufficient dietary diversity. On the other hand, hygiene conditions, difficulties in accessing drinking water, lack of quality care and services for mothers and their children, and poor eating habits all combine to maintain a vicious circle that Burundi is determined to break by changing the status quo through multisectoral interventions.

Taking action for the health, good nutrition and development of children

To reverse the trend, UNICEF backs government initiatives by being involved and active in both malnutrition prevention and the appropriate treatment of proven cases: “In 2023, for example, thanks to UNICEF’s support, around 1,200,000 children aged from 6 to 59 months were able to receive 2 doses of vitamin A supplements and undergo deworming, while 500,000 children under 2 received multiple micronutrient powders.In addition, over 500,000 breastfeeding mothers and people who look after children will receive specific advice on food and care for infants and young children, as well on good hygiene and sanitation practices,” specifies France Bégin. In parallel to these efforts, 247,382 women have benefited from services to prevent anaemia and other forms of malnutrition, while 75,950 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition received adequate quality care.

Health, however, is not the only way to prevent stunting, which is why UNICEF is participating in multisectoral efforts undertaken by the government of Burundi, including the promotion of agriculture and livestock farming; the implementation of local food system initiatives aimed at improving dietary diversity among children; education; social protection; and access to water and hygiene.

UNICEF is also helping the Burundian government to draft and revise standard documents for nutrition, while providing precious support in conducting nutritional surveys, such as SMART, which inform Burundi’s nutritional policies and strategies.

The focus is this necessity: to follow an action plan encompassing all sectors and involving all local stakeholders in order to strengthen their capacities for action, and to build a future in which each and every Burundian child may flourish.

The sharp increase in refugees in need of aid has placed a significant strain on WFP food assistance programmes in Burundi.

Since January 2025, nearly 70,000 people - mainly women, children and the elderly – have fled fighting in DRC to Burundi, many making dangerous river crossings and walking long distances in search of safety.

More continue to arrive each day, adding to what is already the largest influx into Burundi in decades. Cross border movement into DRC’s other neighbours, including Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania, is also increasing due to the escalating conflict in the country’s east and this threatens to worsen hunger across the region.

“Refugees are arriving every day, some weighed down with hastily packed bundles and suitcases, and others with nothing but the clothes on their backs,” said Dragica Pajevic, WFP’s Deputy Regional Director for eastern Africa, who is currently on the ground supporting operations in Burundi.

“The number of refugees has doubled in just a few weeks, but funding has not kept pace. Our available resources are stretched beyond capacity, and we are being forced to adapt our operations and reduce rations to reach as many people as possible.”

Of the 70,000 people who have arrived in Burundi from DRC in recent weeks, 60,000 have been registered for food assistance, doubling WFP’s total refugee caseload to 120,000 in just a few weeks.

WFP is providing hot meals to the new Congolese refugees, who are housed in temporary transit camps, schools, churches and sports stadiums.

Meanwhile, WFP’s existing refugees are receiving food rations – provided as a mix of in-kind food and cash. But to stretch limited resources, WFP was forced in March to reduce rations for existing refugees from 75 percent to 50 percent.

WFP currently only has the funds to sustain operations for 120,000 refugees through June. Without additional financial support, WFP will be forced to suspend food assistance entirely from July – or even earlier as refugee numbers continue to increase as conflict in eastern DRC intensifies.

The agency urgently needs US$19.8 million to maintain adequate support to the most vulnerable until the end of the year.

Income-generating projects in Burundi have experienced a decline since the escalation of conflict in eastern DRC last February.

The Gatumba sector, located along the western border of the Democratic Republic of Congo, has seen the most significant impact on trade and transportation.

Many families living along National Road 4, which connects Bujumbura and Uvira, are struggling economically due to a sharp drop in traffic.

Pascal Nt., a driver on the Bujumbura Gatumba-Uvira route, states, "Nowadays, we only have a couple of passengers traveling from Uvira to Burundi, sometimes just two. The situation has changed drastically. We used to expect at least four clients from Uvira, which would have been a relief, but now we often return home without any passengers."

The substantial trade volume between Burundi and eastern DRC has made National Route 4 quite lucrative.

However, Congolese buyers have ceased purchasing from a major market in the capital.

Fiston Mulondani, another driver on the Uvira Gatumba route, expresses his disappointment about the situation. "Things were much better before. I could start my day bringing passengers from Uvira to Bujumbura, and I could make two trips daily. But everything changed for the worse around mid-February."

In the fourth quarter of 2023, over 89% of Burundi's exports were directed to the DRC, highlighting its importance as a market.

However, the border closure and the surge of refugees have led to a significant slowdown in trade with the DRC, raising alarms about a potential economic crisis.

Aid operations in Burundi are under strain as thousands continue to flee escalating conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

In less than a month, nearly 63,000 people have crossed into Burundi—marking the country’s largest refugee influx in decades. On 5 March alone, more than 1,100 people arrived, and while numbers have slightly declined, hundreds still enter daily through 11 border points, most of them unofficial. The majority are women, children, and the elderly, with many having been displaced before.

"I don't know what to feel, I fled here during previous conflicts," said Congolese refugee Sikujua Bisimura said. "Now I am here for the second time, there is no peace."

More than 45,000 refugees are currently sheltering at a stadium in Rugombo, near the DRC border, awaiting relocation to designated camps. The site has exceeded capacity, forcing some families to sleep in open fields or with host communities.

UNHCR and partners are working to provide emergency aid, including food, water, and medical assistance, but resources are stretched thin.

"The women and children lack everything, particularly shelter," said Aline Irakarama, an associate reporting officer at UNHCR.

A newly established protection desk is identifying urgent needs among arrivals, particularly unaccompanied children, survivors of sexual violence, and those with serious health conditions.

In Musenyi, a designated refugee site in the south, arrivals are settling into communal shelters as more housing is built. The site, designed for 10,000 people, is already 60 percent full. The Burundian government is working to identify additional land for refugee camps.

Medical care remains a critical need, including treatment for the wounded and psychosocial support for trauma victims. Efforts are also underway to ensure refugee children can continue their education, with plans to construct additional classrooms.

Burundi is among several countries facing severe funding shortages for refugee support. Without immediate financial aid, the situation will worsen, putting more lives at risk.

Since the recent surge in fighting, over 85,000 people have fled DRC to neighbouring countries—compared to fewer than 7,000 in the first two months of 2024 alone.

In just two weeks, over 60,000 people have crossed into Burundi, fleeing deadly violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Many of these families had already been displaced within DRC and are now seeking refuge in neighbouring Burundi. The majority of those arriving are women and children, escaping ongoing conflict in eastern DRC.

As the fighting moves closer to the town of Uvira, near the official border crossing, this number is expected to rise. UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, commends Burundi's decision to grant refugees prima facie status, ensuring they receive immediate protection and critical humanitarian aid.

These new arrivals are primarily Congolese citizens who had already been displaced by past conflicts, now forced to flee once again due to fresh clashes. Some have travelled from as far as Goma, hundreds of kilometres to the north—another tragic example of repeated displacement in East Africa.

UNHCR and its partners are working tirelessly to assist these refugees, providing essential items like warm meals, water, sleeping materials, and hygiene supplies. Local community organizations are also offering invaluable support.

Brigitte Mukanga-Eno, the UNHCR Representative in Burundi, recently visited refugees in Kaburantwa, listening to their concerns and assessing their needs. Those arriving are being transferred to the Musenyi refugee site, which can accommodate 10,000 people. UNHCR staff are assisting with registration and transportation, ensuring refugees are safely relocated.

The Government of Burundi is also planning to allocate additional land to expand the refugee sites, providing much-needed shelter and support.

The rights group says authorities have responded to attacks nationwide with a heavy-handed approach.

Burundi’s security agencies have committed violations against people suspected of belonging to opposition parties or of working with armed opposition groups, according to Human Rights Watch.

In a report published on Wednesday, the United States-based rights group said national intelligence services, police, and governing party youth members have responded to attacks on both civilians and state agents in the country with a heavy-handed approach.

The HRW said the authorities have shown little regard for credible investigations, objective evidence, or due process needed to hold those actually responsible for the attacks, to account.

“Instead of targeting perceived opponents, President Evariste Ndayishimiye’s administration should focus on bringing those responsible for abuse to justice, including members of the security forces,” said Clémentine de Montjoye, Africa researcher at HRW.

“Burundians will only stop living in fear when their tormentors are held to account,” she added.

HRW said it interviewed more than 30 people, including victims and witnesses of violations, family members, opposition party representatives, and Burundian human rights defenders between October 2021 and April 2022.

The rights group said it also analysed and authenticated footage showing several army and police officers admitting to killings and reviewed the reports of local and international human rights organisations, media reports, public speeches of government officials, and social media posts.

EU, US criticised

The rights group criticised the European Union, the United States and other countries for pursuing a policy of rapprochement with the Burundi authorities despite overwhelming evidence of rights abuses.

“Governments and regional and international institutions engaging with Burundi should ensure that serious human rights violations … are on the agenda and that concrete and measurable actions are proposed to address them,” HRW said.

It called on the government to publicly condemn human rights violations, and conduct transparent investigations to hold suspects accountable.

The HRW also said armed groups in Burundi should cease committing human rights abuses and acts of violence against state agents and civilians.

In 2015, Burundi’s then-President Pierre Nkurunziza sought to change the constitution to hand himself a third term. He faced significant internal and external political opposition – including a failed coup attempt.

His government responded by unleashing a wave of political violence, persecution and human rights violations against real and perceived opponents. Burundi was sent into a tailspin of violent clashes, and political and economic uncertainty.

Since then, the EU and the US first imposed visa restrictions on the perpetrators of the violence. Wide-ranging economic sanctions soon followed in response to Nkurunziza’s destructive actions.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Dozens of Burundian troops have been detained for refusing to be deployed to eastern Congo in the fight against the M23 rebel group as it advances toward a major border city, according to army officers, prison officials and other witnesses.

The dissenting soldiers were being held in at least four prisons across the tiny central African country, they told The Associated Press.

Clashes between M23, which the U.S. says is backed by Rwanda, and Congolese troops have intensified in recent weeks with the rebels threatening the Congo city of Goma on the Rwanda border.

Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye, in a public broadcast on Dec. 29, acknowledged the presence of Burundian troops in eastern Congo under the terms of a defense pact with Congolese authorities.

“If you do not help your neighbor put out the fire when his house is burning, tomorrow, if it is your turn, he will not come to help you,” he said. “If Burundi is going to help (Congo), it is defending itself.”

He said in that address that it was “normal for Burundian soldiers to be killed on Congolese territory.”

Tensions have been rising in Africa’s Great Lakes region as Rwanda, Burundi and Congo trade accusations over support for violent rebel groups operating in the lawless areas of eastern Congo.

Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi has accused Rwanda’s government of actively supporting M23, which controls territory near the Rwanda border. U.N. experts have cited “solid evidence” that members of Rwanda’s armed forces were conducting operations in support of the rebels in eastern Congo. Rwanda denies supporting the M23.

At the same time, Burundi is accusing Rwanda of supporting another Congo-based rebel group opposed to Burundi’s government. The group, known as RED-Tabara, has claimed responsibility for multiple deadly attacks inside Burundi. The latest attack, in which at least nine people were killed, happened on Sunday.

Burundi last month suspended diplomatic relations with Rwanda and closed their border, calling it a response to Rwanda’s alleged backing of RED-Tabara, which is based in Congo’s South Kivu province. Rwanda denies the allegation.

Burundian authorities have not revealed how many troops have been deployed to eastern Congo. They also haven’t commented on the arrests of soldiers who refuse deployment across the border. Brig. Gaspard Baratuza, the Burundian military spokesman, did not respond to requests for comment.

According to two army officers and multiple prison guards who spoke to the AP, the arrests of dissenting soldiers started in December, with more than 200 detained. They include at least 103 in the Rumonge prison in the southwest, two prison guards there said. Others were being held in remand centers in Ngozi in the north, Ruyigi in the east, and Bururi in the south, according to prison guards in each of those penal institutions.

An army colonel in Bujumbura, the commercial capital, said many soldiers have been imprisoned “for having refused to fight alongside the (Congolese army) against the M23.” Some also face additional charges of stealing war funds, he said, without elaborating.

“Some have already been dismissed from the army, but there are also some who have been acquitted. It is no secret that many soldiers are detained for these acts,” he said.

The colonel, like others who spoke about the detentions, requested anonymity because of safety concerns.

A Burundian army captain told the AP he had deserted the military after refusing to be sent to Congo. “For a professional soldier to engage in combat, there must at least be the motive for the conflict,” he said. “He must also measure his strengths and weaknesses and those of the enemy. But in the current situation we are being asked to go and fight blindly.”

Washington has urged de-escalation of tensions in eastern Congo, where M23 is one of more than 100 armed groups active in eastern Congo, seeking a share of the region’s gold and other resources as they carry out mass killings.

Many M23 fighters, including Congolese Tutsis, were once members of Congo’s army. The group’s leaders say they are fighting to protect local Tutsis from extremist Hutu groups such as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, whose members were among the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide against minority Tutsis in Rwanda.

Rwandan authorities cited concerns over this armed group in a statement last week rejecting U.S. calls for Rwanda to withdraw its troops and missile systems from Congolese territory.

BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) — Burundi seems to be running short of everything but patience.

A deadly nationwide political crackdown in the East African nation is now in the past. But the return to international favor, and benefits like development assistance that come with it, has been slow. As always, everyday citizens feel it most.

It’s never been easy in landlocked Burundi, which at times has been described as the world’s poorest country, according to United Nations figures.

The list of commodities in short supply in recent months has ranged from fuel to sugar. But an electricity shortage is hitting the hardest, slowing attempts at economic recovery.

Power outages occur every day, often for more than two hours at a time, unusual even in a region where many governments struggle to meet electricity demand.

The years of being relatively offline from some key international partners have taken a toll. Current President Evariste Ndayishimiye has vowed reforms, and slowly, partners like the European Union and United States have eased sanctions.

Burundi has been on a path of relative stability. In January, the World Bank announced a new grant of up to $40 million to help the government avert acute commodity shortages. The project focuses on improving the credibility of Burundi’s financial system.

Also in January, however, complications arose. Burundi closed its border with Rwanda, accusing its neighbor of backing rebels, which Rwanda denied. Burundian authorities have said the border closure is not responsible for the widespread commodity shortages as most trade comes in via Congo, but an important trading partner has been affected.

Burundi has few exports and is heavily reliant on donor support, making its international relations key.

Residents say the most pressing issue to address these days is the unreliable power supply, which can shut down business across the country for hours on end.

From hospital administrators to hoteliers, Burundians told The Associated Press they are losing money — and the government will, too, when it’s time to collect taxes.

In Ngozi, a town in northern Burundi, hairdresser Anicet Manirambona spoke with frustration about electricity cuts in the middle of doing someone’s hair.

“It can take several hours,” she said. “Angry, the customer decides to leave and will never come back again.”

Some businesses have invested in generators but struggle to find fuel to power them. The supply of petroleum products has been sporadic this year, mostly blamed on foreign currency shortages.

“We are sometimes forced to temporarily interrupt our programs because of the power cut when it is not as easy to obtain fuel to power the generator,” said Bénigne Magendero, director of the Ngozi-based Radio Buntu.

Burundi’s installed electrical capacity stands at about 115 megawatts, and less than 15% of the country’s 12 million people are connected to the national grid, according to official figures.

The country’s 10-year development plan until 2027 says 400 megawatts are needed to meet industrialization goals.

Government authorities blame the power outages on obsolete equipment that dates to the 1960s.

A new hydroelectric power plant under construction in the northwestern province of Cibitoke would add 20 megawatts to the national grid. Two more hydroelectric power plants under construction would add a total of 76 megawatts to the grid when they are commissioned later this year, according to the state-owned utility company known as Regideso.

“When we launch our business, our first priority is to satisfy our customers,” said Evariste Hakizimana, the director of a printing company in the commercial capital of Bujumbura. The erratic power in Burundi “has an impact on the reputation of the company.”

Title: Burundi president names new PM after coup plot claims

President Ndayishimiye, a former army general, gave no reasons for the replacement but had warned of a coup plot against his government last week.

Burundi’s President Evariste Ndayishimiye replaced his prime minister and a top aide in a high-level reshuffle on Wednesday after warning of a “coup” plot against him.

Security Minister Gervais Ndirakobuca was sworn in before parliament as the new premier of the Central African nation.

He succeeds Alain-Guillaume Bunyoni, who was sacked along with Ndayishimiye’s civilian chief of staff General Gabriel Nizigama in the first major reshuffle since the president took office a little more than two years ago.

Lawmakers approved the appointment of Ndirakobuca – a former chief of Burundi’s feared intelligence agency – in a unanimous 113-0 vote at a hastily called parliamentary session earlier on Wednesday.

Ndayishimiye, a 54-year-old former army general, gave no reasons for Bunyoni’s dismissal, but last week he had warned of a coup plot against his government.

“Do you think an army general can be threatened by saying they will make a coup? Who is that person? Whoever it is should come and, in the name of God, I will defeat him,” Ndayishimiye said at a meeting of government officials on Friday in the political capital, Gitega.

The fate of Bunyoni, a former police chief and security minister who has long been a senior figure in the governing CNDD-FDD party, was not immediately known.

Ndirakobuca, a 52-year-old father of eight, is among a number of Burundian officials accused of stoking violence against government opponents in a wave of deadly unrest in 2015. He remains under European Union sanctions.

Ndayishimiye’s new chief of staff – a post sometimes described as a “super prime minister” – is Colonel Aloys Sindayihebura, who was in charge of the domestic branch of the National Intelligence Service.

Legislators had been called to attend the National Assembly session on Wednesday via urgent messages sent overnight on WhatsApp.

Analysts say a cabal of military leaders known as “the generals” wield the true political power in Burundi and the president himself had alluded to his isolation in a 2021 speech.

Ndayishimiye took power in June 2020 after his predecessor Pierre Nkurunziza died of what the Burundian authorities said was heart failure, although there was widespread speculation he had succumbed to COVID-19.

He has been hailed by the international community for slowly ending years of Burundi’s isolationism under Nkurunziza’s bloody rule.

But he has failed to improve its poor record on human rights and boost the economy.

Nkurunziza had launched the brutal 2015 crackdown on political opponents that left 1,200 people dead and made Burundi a global pariah.

The turmoil erupted after he had launched a bid for a third term in office, a move the opposition said was unconstitutional and violated a peace deal that ended the country’s bloody civil war in 2006.

The United States and the EU had imposed sanctions over the unrest that also drove 400,000 people to flee the country, with reports of arbitrary arrests, torture, killings and enforced disappearances.

Burundi has been in the grip of an economic malaise since the 2015 unrest, with a lack of foreign exchange and shortages of basic goods such as fuel, certain foodstuffs, building materials and medicines.

Last week, Ndayishimiye repeated his promise to crack down on monopolies granted to leaders and those close to the government.

Earlier on Wednesday, Burundi’s trade ministry announced the easing of imports of maize, maize flour, sugar and cement in a statement on Twitter, dated September 6.

It follows the import of fuel by a state firm in the last 10 days, meaning petrol stations can be filled up.

In February, Brussels and Washington resumed aid flows to the landlocked nation after easing the 2015 sanctions, citing political progress under Ndayishimiye.

Civil society groups have returned, the BBC is allowed to broadcast again and the EU – Burundi’s largest foreign donor – has commended efforts to fight corruption.

But concerns over rights abuses remain.

In May, Human Rights Watch decried politically motivated murders and kidnappings by police and state-backed youth groups, while a UN inquiry last year characterised the situation as “disastrous”.

Since its independence from Belgium in 1962, Burundi’s history has been littered with presidential assassinations, coups and ethnic massacres.

It was gripped by a brutal civil war from 1993 to 2006 between majority Hutus and minority Tutsis that left some 300,000 people dead, mainly civilians.

Bujumbura, Burundi – Shrouded in darkness, with the journalists and human rights monitors locked in their homes and hotels, unidentified men with machetes, stones, automatic rifles, and grenades mete out vengeance on their political opponents.

A dark and disturbing new chapter has begun in Burundi since police violently put down the street protests that denounced Burundi’s President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to run for a third and, as protesters believe, unconstitutional, term. They say the decision violates the sacrosanct peace agreement that ended the 13-year civil war.

Following a spate of political violence that has killed more than 80 and injured over 400 people, key opposition parties are boycotting the controversial parliamentary election scheduled to take place on June 29.

Hours of darkness

The first few hours after darkness falls on the humid, low-rise lakeside city are often punctuated by the sound of gunfire and grenades.

Ernest Nshimirimana, a 28-year-old supporter of the ruling party, CNDD-FDD , was killed as he returned home after attending a political rally on the night of June 25. Nshimirimana lived in Buterere, a neighbourhood dominated by supporters of well-known opposition candidate and former rebel fighter, Agathon Rwasa.

At the end of the campaign rally, Nshimirimana’s friends, also members of the ruling party’s youth league known as the Imbonerakure , warned him not to go home to Buterere.

“There could be trouble,” one told him.

But Nshimirimana ignored their advice.

At around 9pm, as he walked through the neighbourhood, a gang of anti-government men stoned and beat him to death.

A few hours later, another resident of Buterere, 29-year-old Lin Gahimbare was shot and killed by shadowy assailants inside his own house. His wife and daughter who were in the house survived.

Because the protests were stopped by force, rather than of the protesters' own volition, they feel compelled to use grenades. by Peace activist

The early mornings in the capital are post-mortems of the night before. Citizens gather on roadsides to inspect new dimples from bullets and grenades.

The families of the dead, usually one or two but sometimes more, gather to weep around their lost ones. Pick-up trucks or tuk-tuks, depending on the prosperity of the departed, bear the bodies off to the morgue.

Grenades of protest

Often, the grenade attacks incur no fatalities.

But, during the late morning on June 25, an unknown man in a white Toyota Carina – a vehicle that is ubiquitous on the roads of Bujumbura – hurled a grenade at workers unloading goods on a pavement in the downtown area.

Eight casualties were rushed to the hospital and treated for shrapnel wounds.

As the temperatures in the capital rise, police search vehicles with ever-increasing scrutiny. It is difficult, if not impossible, to know who is orchestrating the attacks.

A peace activist working in Musaga, who asked to remain anonymous for his safety, said the protesters had no option but to turn to grenades.

“Because the protests were stopped by force, rather than of the protesters’ own volition, they feel compelled to use grenades. Opposition leaders and civil society have told them to be peaceful, but the protesters say they have no way to resist peacefully – they must do whatever it takes to be heard,” said the peace activist.

North of the scorching capital, in the cool highlands close to Rwanda, residents of Ngozi, the president’s hometown and Burundi’s second-largest city, are reeling from the first grenade attack in recent memory.

Pascal Nyabenda, a 22-year-old Imbonerakure, recalled how on the evening of June 21 he stepped out of the bar where he worked to collect empty bottles from the street. Someone passing by threw a grenade which landed on the roof of the bar, sending hot, razor-edged shrapnel flying everywhere.

The grenade hit the small bar, known as Chez Didas, which was packed with Sunday evening drinkers. At least three people were killed with more than 30 injured.

Nyabenda, who grew up an orphan, raced inside to find his brother, Claver, and sister, Chantal, bleeding profusely. Later, at the hospital, he was sitting at Chantal’s bedside when he was told his brother had died. Chantal passed away a few hours after that.

Another victim of the attack, 22-year-old Sylvie Niyonkuru, was walking past the bar with her guardian’s baby strapped to her back. A week later, she is still in hospital, recovering from the shrapnel that had lodged itself inside her abdomen.

‘Trigger for civil war’?

None of those admitted to Ngozi hospital have money to pay for their treatment.

Burundi is the second poorest country in the world according to the World Bank, with a per capita GDP of just $271.

Dr Philbert Sendegeye, the medical director at the hospital, said he was “astounded” by the attack. “There are no divisions here.”

The victims have no money to pay for their care, he said. “These people are poor. They don’t have the means to buy drugs. The hospital is providing the care for free, but we’re not supposed to – so it’s a loss for us,” Sendegeye said.

Independent radio stations in Burundi are all off-air, having been attacked by pro-government security forces in the wake of the failed coup of May 13.

The only national information source for Burundians is the state-controlled broadcaster, RTNB, which many believe whitewashes the problems as a mouthpiece for the government.

Reports of attacks travel by WhatsApp or Facebook to the few who have smartphones, phone calls or word of mouth.

On Friday, those in Cibitoke, a town on the western border with Congo, woke to news that the leader of the opposition party, FRODEBU, Jean-Paul Ngendakumana, had been killed and his wife injured during the night in a machete attack. The week before, the leader of the Imbonerakure in the nearby town of Bubanza was killed by a grenade.

RELATED: Political unrest turns deadly in Burundi

In light of increasing tit-for-tat killings, IHS Jane’s Country Risk analysis has flagged a ruling party victory in the parliamentary poll on Monday as a “likely trigger for civil war in Burundi”.

Jeremy Ciza, a 53-year-old farmer in a rural northern province called Kayanza, knows little of these isolated incidents. But he can feel the war is coming.

There have been fewer vehicles on the main road that crosses Kayanza, he said, so sales of charcoal and vegetables on the roadside are down.

With the devaluation of the Burundian franc, and the supply chain blockages, prices of staple foods such as potatoes have risen threefold over the last year, Ciza said.

Children gather around him to listen, the close-cropped hair on the heads patchy and patterned due to malnutrition. On Ciza’s chest, every rib is visible.

“We have a saying in Kirundi,” he said of the local dialect. “When two oxen fight, it’s the grass that suffers.”

A coup attempt has been launched in Burundi to try to overthrow President Pierre Nkurunziza, amid unrest over his bid to be re-elected to a third term.

Thousands of people in the capital, Bujumbura, celebrated the announcement by Major General Godefroid Niyombare.

But the coup outcome is far from clear.

The presidency said it had been foiled. Mr Nkurunziza left a summit he was attending in Tanzania to try to return home but some unconfirmed reports say his plane has now returned to Tanzania.

Gen Niyombare said in a radio address he had ordered "the closure of the airport and border, and I ask every citizen and law enforcement down to the airport to protect it".

Mr Nkurunziza had been in Dar es Salaam to discuss the crisis with regional leaders. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete said the summit condemned the coup.

Coup attempt: Wednesday's events as they happened

A statement from the Burundi presidency said: "It is with regret that we have learned that a group from the armed forces mutinied this morning and declared an imaginary coup.

Emotions ran high on Tuesday as 19 people killed in an attack last Friday in Gatumba, Mutimbuzi commune, Bujumbura province, on the Burundi-Congolese border, were laid to rest.

In the presence of the authorities, including the Minister of the Interior, Community Development and Public Security, deputies and senators, and the victims' families, coffins containing the bodies of the victims arrived at the Gatumba Catholic parish in military and police vehicles.

A final tribute was paid. A large crowd had come to bid farewell to their parents, children and wives, who had been killed by gunmen on the night of December 22, 2023. Jostling to see the bodies of their deceased loved ones, many could not hold back their tears.

Afterwards, a requiem mass was held under the aegis of Monsignor Anatole Ruberinyange who stressed that "killing people" is by no means a solution to problems. Only dialogue can resolve conflicts.

"In any conflict, the answer is not to shed blood or take up arms. Killing is not a solution to problems. On the contrary, killers reap the curse" the prelate told the congregants the mass.

The attack in the locality of Vugizo claimed 19 civilian victims and one policeman, according to the Burundian government. It was claimed by the rebel group RED-Tabara (Resistance for the Rule of Law in Burundi) that has been battling Burundi’s government from bases in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since 2015.

It is the second attack in two weeks by the RED-Tabara rebels, who have been largely inactive inside Burundi since 2021.

In a press release issued on Saturday, December 23, the government condemned the attack as a despicable and barbaric act of terrorism.

Eighty-seven people were killed in violence that broke out after three military sites were attacked in Burundi on Friday, the army says.

Eight of those who died were security officers and 49 people were captured, Col Gaspard Baratuza said.

Residents in the capital earlier said the bodies of some 34 men were found on the streets - and accused police of taking revenge. It is not clear if that number is included in the army's total.

Unrest has hit Burundi since April.

There have been continued protests since President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his decision to seek a third term in office, which he won in a disputed election in July.

Scores of people are leaving their homes in Burundi's capital ahead of a promised government crackdown.

A cycle of violence began in April with protests against President Pierre Nkurunziza's third-term bid.

Mr Nkurunziza gave a deadline of midnight on Saturday for Burundians to hand in illegal firearms or face being "dealt with as enemies of the nation".

Earlier this week, the UN secretary-general condemned the "inflammatory rhetoric" in Burundi.

And the Brussels-based International Crisis Group said, external the language was "chillingly similar" to that used in Rwanda before the genocide of 1994.

Agencies reported that many people were leaving Cibitoke and Mutakura, two neighbourhoods of the capital, Bujumbura, that have seen anti-government protests.

Landslides triggered by heavy rains kill at least 26 and injure seven, with 10 others missing, security ministry says.

At least 26 people have been killed by landslides triggered by heavy rains in northwestern Burundi, according to the government.

In a Twitter post on Thursday, the security ministry said seven people were also injured while 10 others were still missing following the landslides that struck Cibitoke province.

The ministry identified the areas affected as Nyempundu, Gikomero and Rukombe, near the border with Rwanda.

Homes and fields in the area had also been damaged and search-and-rescue operations were ongoing, it said.

Éboulement de terrains suite aux fortes pluies tombées hier à Nyempundu, Gikomero et Rukombe (zone Nyamakarabo, commune Mugina en @CibitokeProv) : 26 morts, 07 blessés et 10 personnes non encore retrouvées. Des maisons, champs et biens aussi endommagés. Fouilles en cours. — BurundiMIDCSP (@BurundiMIDCSP) December 5, 2019

TRANSLATION: Landslide following heavy rains yesterday in Nyempundu, Gikomero and Rukombe (Nyamakarabo zone, Mugina commune in @CibitokeProv): 26 dead, 07 injured and 10 people not yet found. Houses, fields and property also damaged. Excavations in progress.

“They are still digging up dead bodies,” a local government official told Reuters news agency by telephone.

Separately, AFP news agency gave a death toll of at least 38 people, citing a provisional police tally: three in Gikomero, 13 in Rukombe and 22 died in Nyempundu.

“It happened in the night, when everyone was at home, and landslides hit three very steep hills and buried everything in their path,” a witness told AFP.

“Whole families were buried alive in their homes or in the fields. It was terrifying.”

Floods, landslides and a cyclone have killed more than 1,200 people across East and southern Africa this year, according to a Save the Children count based on United Nations and government figures.

Flooding has also displaced nearly half a million people in South Sudan, 200,000 in Ethiopia and at least 370,000 in Somalia this year, the UN said.

East Africa has been experiencing torrential rains in recent weeks that have cost the lives of at least 58 people in Tanzania in the first half of April, and 13 people in Kenya.

Burundi, which the U.N. says is one of the 20 countries most vulnerable to climate change, has been pelted by almost non-stop rain since September, with its main city of Bujumbura ravaged by floods.

"The heavy rainfall due to the El Nino phenomenon is causing severe flooding linked to overflowing rivers and the rising waters of Lake Tanganyika. Landslides, strong winds and hail continue to expose communities to different vulnerabilities," Interior Minister Martin Niteretse and UN resident coordinator Violet Kenyana Kakyomya said in a joint statement Tuesday.

Between September and April 7, a total of 203,944 people were affected while the number of internally displaced people increased by 25 percent to 96,000, they said.

The statement referred to a "loss of human life," without giving any further details, adding that homes and livelihoods, crop fields and infrastructure had been destroyed.

The government of President Evariste Ndayishimiye has been under fire for several weeks, particularly from civil society groups and the opposition, which are calling for the authorities to declare a state of emergency or natural disaster.

Usually there are two rainy seasons between September and January and March to May, but the situation has been exacerbated by the El Nino weather phenomenon.

Weather forecasts predict rainfall significantly above normal until May and "the government and humanitarian actors need financial resources to face the growing challenges and avoid a deterioration" of the crisis, the joint statement said.

It said 306,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance in Burundi, ranked by the World Bank as the poorest country on the planet in terms of per capita GDP.

In the economic capital Bujumbura, which lies on the northeastern shore of Lake Tanganyika, several neighborhoods have been flooded, roads and bridges destroyed, and some hotels and hospitals abandoned because of rising water levels.

The water level in Africa's second largest lake reached 77.04 metres (over 250 foot) on April 12, just 36 centimeters shy of its 1964 record, disaster prevention agency head Anicet Nibaruta said on Friday, according to Burundian media.

El Nino often has devastating consequences in East Africa, where in December alone, more than 300 people died in torrential rains and floods in Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.

From October 1997 to January 1998, massive floods caused more than 6,000 deaths in five countries in the region.

Hundreds of protesters marched along the streets of Burundi’s capital Bujumbura on Saturday over a UN report released on Tuesday accusing the Burundian government of carrying out human rights abuses.

Waving placards, the protesters marched past the UN offices in the capital denouncing the report.

“Even if they release more reports that are far from the truth. I will still stand as a elected official and together with the people I will still protest and dismiss the reports,” said Remy Barampama, a Senator in Bujumbura.

The report by three Independent investigators tasked by the UN Human Rights Council indicated that the Burundian government had committed gross human rights violations in some cases amounting to crimes against humanity.

It listed 17 types of torture used by the security forces, ranging from attaching weights to the testicles, to forcing a victim to sit on broken glass, or to stay next to the dead body of a relative.

Violence in the country soared after President Pierre Nkurunziza contested to seek a third term in office which the oppostion termed as unconstitutional.

Responding to the UN, Burundi’s government said that the UN is biased and the investigators were politically motivated and their conclusions were based on anonymous and unverifiable sources.

Burundi’s government has set up three commissions of inquiry to look into human rights violations but the UN report accused the government of ‘blatantly failing’ to investigate.

WASHINGTON, July 1, 2024 — A new World Bank-financed project will support flood mitigation and resilience in Bujumbura, combining high-impact investments for flood risk management, flood resilience, and help to improve the country’s climate-resilient urban management.

Burundi is one of the most densely populated countries in the world and is vulnerable to climate-related events. The Burundi Urban Resilience Emergency Project (URP), called locally “IBISAGARA BIRAMA”, has been designed to meet urgent needs to combat flooding in Bujumbura, which is accentuated by frequent risks of flood due to climate change and the recent risk of water increase in Lake Tanganyika. It will finance urgent rehabilitation and dredging of rivers running through the city and provide more permanent protection against flooding from the lake and rivers to areas that are dense in economic activity and vulnerable populations. It will also provide protection for key infrastructure to prevent interruptions to the water supply of the city.

« The project came at the right time considering the increase of urban flooding in Burundi due to climate change. This is impacting large parts of the population and resulting in foregone economic growth every year. The project will support key institutions to improve urban management with the objective of reducing flood risk while providing better early warnings and improving the capacity of government institutions and communities to respond to disasters,” says Hawa Wagué, World Bank Country Manager for Burundi.

With $113 million in funding (with a $60 million IDA* grant and $53 million from the Crisis Response Window Plus) the project aims to respond to urban flooding problems in Bujumbura and lay the groundwork for provision of more climate-resilient urban services in Burundi. Efforts will focus on emergency measures for flood response, climate-resilient infrastructure interventions to reduce flood risk, flood early warning systems, and the elaboration of risk-informed land-use plans. The project is expected to benefit the population of Bujumbura, including more than 200,000 people directly affected by the ongoing flood emergency.

The project will finance both traditional infrastructure and green solutions. The emergency interventions will cover the whole city while the majority of investments will be targeted in the most affected catchment areas in Bujumbura, selected based on the ability to address the flood risks of today and assure long-term outcomes and alignment with social equity considerations that align with wider development plans. All construction and rehabilitation activities will ensure that the built infrastructure is resilient to future climate shocks by applying build-back-better principles.

The URP was supported through grant funds provided by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR).

* The World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, helps the world’s low-income countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve people’s lives. IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for its 75 client countries, 39 of which are in Africa. Since 1960, IDA has provided $552 billion to 115 countries.

Burundi is grappling with a growing crisis as landslides intensify, sparking alarm in both the economic capital, Bujumbura, and the surrounding provinces. The western part of the city has already witnessed the collapse of several houses, instilling fear among residents along the Ntahangwa River.

Pelagie Niyukuri, a resident, expresses gratitude for being alive amid the precarious ravine. During rains, panic ensues as residents fear a potential collapse, leading to a perilous plunge into the Ntahangwa. About sixty kilometers away in Cibitoke, the same phenomenon is causing panic, with landslides engulfing hectares of crops and homes.

Mathias Karikuriyo, a resident of Rusiga, voices the collective terror, fearing burial beneath nightly landslides. The plea to the government is desperate, urging relocation to ensure the safety of families and children.

The escalating landslides pose a deeply concerning challenge for the government. Saidi Anicet, Chief of Staff of the Governor of Cibitoke, emphasizes the need to prioritize saving the population. Urgent action is required, including the relocation of communities from dangerous areas to prevent mass exodus from collapsing lands.

To address this phenomenon, environmentalists propose a natural stabilization approach as a crucial first step. Leonard Nibigira, an environmental expert, advocates for the selection of stabilizing crops or plants. Bamboo, in particular, emerges as an effective choice due to its negligible weight and extensive root system, aiding in soil stabilization and enhancing cohesion.

The scars of 2019 resurface as landslides in the Mugina commune, Cibitoke province, resulted in over 24 fatalities, 7 injuries, and more than 30 people missing. The region also suffered significant material damage, underscoring the urgent need for proactive measures.

Since 2018, sudden onset climate shocks, in particular torrential rains, floods and strong winds that occurred in Burundi have affected 1,016,849 persons, including 196,171 individuals that have been displaced. Between January 2018 and December 2024, the main affected provinces were Kirundo (179,435 individuals affected), Bujumbura Rural (171,359 individuals affected) and Ngozi (167,135 individuals affected). Alongside the severe human impact, these disasters destroyed many houses (85,592), infrastructures (781 classrooms and 640 other infrastructures), and lead to crop field damage that affected an estimated 112,664 households.

Burundi floods: Lake Tanganyika's water levels rise

Fishing and farming are the main sources of income for people living along Lake Tanganyika

Natural disasters have forced more than 100,000 people to flee their homes in Burundi in recent years, the Save the Children charity says.

Most of them had lived on the shores of Lake Tanganyika where water levels had risen because of heavy storms, causing floods and landslides.

People described waking up at night to find their homes and farms swallowed by the lake, the world's second-deepest.

Save the Children said it was the "forgotten crisis".

Lake Tanganyika runs through Burundi and several other African states.

It is the longest fresh water lake in the world. Its water levels rose to 776.4 metres (2,547.2ft) above sea level in April compared with the normal average of 772.7 metres.

Many factors contribute to flooding, but a warming atmosphere caused by climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely.

The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions.

Thousands of members of the Imbonerakure, Burundi’s ruling party’s youth wind, joined by President Evariste Ndayishimiye celebrated their national holiday on Saturday.

In a speech delivered in the middle of a stadium pitch in Makamba, President Ndayishimiye praised the bravery of the Imbonerakure who he said had defended the country from attacks perpetrated with foreign aid.

"In 2016, our enemies attacked us with foreign aid. The UN condemned us, Europe condemned us, and other countries still support colonisation. But thanks to the bravery of the Imbonerakure (the youth league of the ruling CNDD-FDD party), no one touched us and today our country stands tall," defended proudly President Evariste Ndayishimiye.

At a staggering 50 000 members, according to Burundi’s most prominent human rights activist, the Imbonerakure from the Kurundi language meaning “those who see far”, have been described as a militia by the UN.

Human rights groups have also repeatedly raised concerns that the youth wing has virtually become a law unto itself.

"We end by encouraging all the Imbonerakure. Those who have managed to get here and those who have not. Continue to be heroes, defend the honour of Burundians and Africans because you are the light, you are the pillars of peace and development, you are our future," added Révérien Ndikuriyo, secretary general of the CNDD-FDD party.

The group arose in 2010 out of disarmed fighters from the ruling party. The previous regime of slain former President Pierre Nkurunziza had strongly armed the youth league as he sought to extend his rule in 2015 despite the constitutional two-term limit.

Burundi human rights activists expressed outrage Tuesday over an online video that shows pro-government youth militia members teaching young students songs comparing the opposition to lice.



The video of Imbonerakure militia members follows a recent video in which they encouraged the rape and impregnation of opposition supporters.



Burundi has been plagued by deadly political violence since President Pierre Nkurunziza successfully sought a disputed third term in 2015. Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands have fled the country.



Lawyer and activist Lambert Nigarura told The Associated Press that the latest hate messages are meant to depict ethnic Tutsi as bad people, and he called it “the final step in preparation of genocide.” He urged the international community to take action against Imbonerakure activities in schools.



The latest video was filmed by a local human rights group in Burundi. It shows Imbonerakure members singing with schoolchildren in the local Kirundi language, saying their president in 1993 was assassinated in cold blood. Melchior Ndadaye was Burundi's first ethnic Hutu president, and the country's Tutsi-led army was blamed for killing him.

In the video, the Imbonerakure asks whether those who killed the president have stopped the killings, and the children reply that the killers have not stopped and they know them well.



Another Burundian human rights activist, Vital Nshimiyimana, called the songs “terrifying.”



Burundi has faced similar tensions between Hutu and Tutsi as neighboring Rwanda, where the 1994 genocide left more than 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu dead. What sparked it was hate speech against the Tutsi minority spread by Hutu extremists.



In Burundi, ruling party members have called the Imbonerakure peaceful. But Human Rights Watch earlier this year reported that Imbonerakure members had brutally killed, tortured and severely beaten scores of people across the country.

Floodwaters from Lake Tanganyika and the Rusizi River have displaced thousands of people in Burundi, plunging communities into a state of crisis. Villages on the lake’s shores are among the most severely affected, with residents forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in makeshift shelters under dire conditions. Host communities, already burdened by limited resources, are struggling to provide for the influx of displaced families.

Carolyne Bii of CGTN first reported on this unfolding humanitarian crisis, shedding light on the plight of those caught in the devastating wake of flooding.

In the town of Gatumba, located in Bujumbura’s Mutimbuzi commune, the effects of climate change have been acutely felt for nearly a decade. Rising waters have submerged entire villages and parts of the town, forcing residents to evacuate to temporary camps. These camps, however, offer no respite from hardship, as described by Suzanne Ntakarutimana, one of the displaced residents.

“We fled from the water that destroyed our houses. A Samaritan put us up here. We can’t go home because the water is up to our chests—the river burst its banks. It’s impossible to rebuild. Here, we don’t have enough to eat and very little to wear. We’re outside, and when it rains, we all get wet,” she shared.

The situation is worsening as water levels continue to rise, with many host families already strained beyond capacity. The displaced, like Niyibizi Pascasie, recount the heartbreak of seeing their homes destroyed not once but multiple times.

“We were invaded by water. We had to look for a dryer place. A neighbor gave us this space in the Mushasha 1 neighborhood. We’ve been here for five years, but then it rained again, and the water flooded the whole neighborhood. This time, it even washed away our house. Now we have nothing to rebuild with,” Pascasie lamented.

Residents and local leaders are calling on the government to construct a dyke to mitigate the flooding. Gerard Shamuruvugo, a camp leader who lost his retirement savings to the floods, emphasized the need for long-term solutions.

“The government should build a dyke. After that, Gatumba will be saved. Otherwise, our area, particularly Mushasha 1, will remain submerged,” Shamuruvugo stated.

Authorities acknowledge the scale of the problem but note that constructing a dyke would require substantial funding, likely from international donors. While relocation has been proposed, displaced families—some of whom have moved repeatedly over the years—are demanding permanent solutions.

Burundi’s experience echoes the challenges faced by other nations grappling with extreme weather events. Torrential rains triggered by the El Niño phenomenon last April and May further compounded the crisis, displacing even more people. According to the United Nations, more than 306,000 people in Burundi currently require emergency humanitarian assistance due to floods and other disasters.

This crisis underscores the urgent need for sustainable measures to address climate-induced disasters in vulnerable regions, where the human cost of inaction grows with each passing year.

Nairobi (AFP) – The government of Burundi and the United Nations have launched an appeal for financial aid to cope with the "devastating effects" of months of relentless rainfall that has displaced nearly 100,000 people.

East Africa has been experiencing torrential rains in recent weeks that have cost the lives of at least 58 people in Tanzania in the first half of April, and 13 people in Kenya.

Burundi, which the UN says is one of the 20 countries most vulnerable to climate change, has been pelted by almost non-stop rain since September, with its main city of Bujumbura ravaged by floods.

"The heavy rainfall due to the El Nino phenomenon is causing severe flooding linked to overflowing rivers and the rising waters of Lake Tanganyika. Landslides, strong winds and hail continue to expose communities to different vulnerabilities," Interior Minister Martin Niteretse and UN resident coordinator Violet Kenyana Kakyomya said in a joint statement Tuesday.

Arrest warrant for Sinduhije relates to attacks, including grenade explosions and ambushes, that have killed dozens and injured several since the start of 2020.

Burundi has issued an international arrest warrant against exiled opposition politician Alexis Sinduhije, accusing him of leading a group responsible for multiple “terrorist acts”.

The announcement, made by the country’s attorney general Sylvestre Nyandwi late on Wednesday, followed a string of attacks in the troubled East African nation in recent days that have left at least six people dead and more than 100 wounded.

However, the warrant related to earlier attacks, including grenade explosions and ambushes that have killed dozens and injured several since the start of 2020, Nyandwi said.

“The investigations already carried out have revealed that these acts are committed by a band of terrorists led by … Alexis Sinduhije”, the attorney general said.

“Under national and international law, these acts constitute acts of terrorism, as well as crimes against humanity.”

Sinduhije, the president of the opposition Movement for Solidarity and Development (MSD), lives in exile in Belgium.

RED-Tabara blamed for violence

He has long been suspected by the Burundian government of being at the helm of RED-Tabara, the most active rebel group in the country – a claim he has always denied.

The group emerged 10 years ago and is accused of being behind many deadly attacks or ambushes in Burundi since 2015.

RED-Tabara has a rear base in South Kivu in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo and is estimated to number between 500 and 800.

Last year, the group said it was behind a series of attacks that killed more than 40 people from the security forces and the youth league of the governing CNDD-FDD party.

It claimed responsibility for a series of mortar blasts targeting the airport in Burundi’s financial capital, Bujumbura, on Saturday night.

No damage or casualties occurred.

Deadly grenade attacks also struck the capital, Gitega, on Sunday evening and Bujumbura on Monday night. The group has not commented on these.

The attorney general said those blasts were “linked” to the earlier attacks that Sinduhije is accused of carrying out. He did not provide further details.

On Thursday, the MSD said it rejected “the unfounded accusations of a government incapable of ensuring the safety of its citizens”.

“Neither our leaders nor our members are oriented towards violence against our fellow citizens,” it added.

In addition to Sinduhije, arrest warrants have also been issued against Francois Nyamoya, MSD’s secretary general based in Rwanda, and Marguerite Brankitse, founder of the Maison Shalom home for orphans, who lives between Rwanda and Europe.

Uvira: several households continue to flee the Itombwe sector where fighting between the Burundian army and the Red-Tabara rebels is taking place

Thousands of people from the Itombwe sector in Mwenga territory in the South Kivu province in eastern Congo continue to flee violent fighting between the Burundian rebels of Red-Tabara and the FDNB (Force de la Défense Nationale du Burundi ). The rebels claim to have killed about forty Burundian soldiers.

A spokesman for the Burundian army mocks them.

INFO SOS Médias Burundi

Civil society in the Itombwe sector announces that the inhabitants of the villages of Malanda, Ngumiyano, Kaberukwa, Ibaciro, Nalubombeko, Acika and Ilambo have fled their homes. Some have headed to the village of Kitibingi, others have found refuge in Kitopu while another part has fled to the natural forest of Itombwe.

According to local administrators, the displaced are exposed to diseases because they spend the night in the forest during this rainy season.

“They are also exposed to insecurity because in the forest there is neither army nor police. It is the rebels who are the masters of the forest,” they say. Residents told SOS Médias Burundi that they had noticed a large presence of Mai-Mai militiamen.

In a statement released Saturday by the Burundian rebels of Red-Tabara, the armed group announced that its fighters have been fighting for over a week with the Burundian army and the Mai-Mai in Ngumiyano, Kaberukwa and Ibaciro in the Itombwe sector.

These Burundian rebels say that in these fights, they killed 45 Burundian soldiers and injured 32 others.

Brigadier General Gaspard Baratuza, in charge of communications and public relations within the FDNB, chose X (Formerly Twitter) to respond to Red-Tabara.

“Red-Tabara, losing momentum after suffering heavy losses in its combat adventures, quickly rushed to launch press releases to console itself by invoking the results of others (FDNB) without saying anything on its side,” he wrote.

Since 2018, the Burundian army has been pursuing the Red-Tabara rebels in South Kivu, sometimes aided by the Imbonerakure (members of the youth league of the CNDD-FDD, the presidential party in Burundi) and the Mai-Mai militiamen. The armed group also had Mai-Mai with whom it collaborated. But there are some who have withdrawn. It was only in August 2022 that the Burundian military authorities recognized the presence of the FDNB in ​​South Kivu, evoking a bilateral partnership between the Burundian and Congolese governments. Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye would later confirm this.

Since then, the Burundian rebels have lost their bases in Kiryama, Kitavuzampegere, Malimba, Masango, Rugezi, Kabanja, Tabunde and Ngumiyano, which were located in the territories of Uvira, Fizi and Mwenga.

Last August, the Burundian army, supported by the Mai-Mai Yakutumba faction and the FARDC (Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo), chased the Burundian rebels from the villages of Rugezi and Kabanja. They are located in the Ngandja sector. They went to settle in Itombwe in the Mwenga territory.

Red-Tabara is on the Burundian government’s list of terrorist movements. Burundian authorities remain convinced that it is equipped and maintained by Rwanda, which led them to close the land borders with Rwanda in January 2024. Burundian President Evariste Ndayishimiye has declared that his Rwandan counterpart is “the enemy of Burundi and a destabiliser of the sub-region”. The Rwandan government responded that “there is no truth in President Evariste Ndayishimiye’s words”.

A map showing the location of Burundi and Rwanda in relation to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

analysis

The RED-Tabara armed group, based in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has renewed attacks in Burundi since late 2023. The group - which is an abbreviation of the French Résistance pour un État de Droit au Burundi (Resistance for Rule of Law in Burundi) - is one of a handful of rebel groups seeking to unseat the Burundi government.

RED-Tabara attacks, however, are targeting civilians rather than government installations, military bases or strategic infrastructure. This has thrown the group's motivations into question.

RED-Tabara was created in 2015 in the aftermath of a political crisis and failed coup by some military officers against Burundi's then president, Pierre Nkurunziza, who died in 2020. The group claims to fight for a return to the rule of law, which it claims the current government has abandoned. However, its indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations are increasingly falling into the pattern of terror acts.

In February 2024, RED-Tabara fighters attacked Buringa village, which is in Burundi on the border with the DRC, killing nine people. Two months earlier, the fighters attacked Vugizo, also in Burundi near the DRC border, killing 20 people.

RED-Tabara operates out of the DRC's volatile eastern region, in South Kivu province. The province shares a porous 243km border with Burundi.

Over the past 15 years, I have studied the conflict dynamics in the Great Lakes region, which includes Burundi, the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda. In my view, the RED-Tabara attacks are part of coordinated actions to use conflict to reshape the region's geopolitics. Political and economic interests, mainly focused on the control of mining areas and the trade of minerals, are playing a key role in the region's dynamics.

The attacks have heightened tensions between Burundi and its neighbour Rwanda. Burundi's president Évariste Ndayishimiye has accused Rwandan authorities of supporting RED-Tabara rebels, a move which has the potential to undermine his country's peace mission in the DRC and its influence in the region.

To protest against this support, Burundi closed its border with Rwanda in January 2024, deported several Rwandan citizens and suspended diplomatic ties. Kigali has repeatedly denied accusations that it supports the rebel group.

The tensions between Rwanda and Burundi are likely to affect economic activities, in particular cross-border trade between the two countries. They could also hinder the implementation of the eight-member East African Community's objectives. These include a common market and, in the future, a political federation.

RED-Tabara origins

RED-Tabara positioned itself as an alternative to the various militia groups that were engaged in internal resistance against Nkurunziza's regime in 2015.

The armed group claims to fight for the rule of law. According to the movement, democracy is in regression in Burundi and the government system is characterised by corruption. The group wants to reinstate the governance system in the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. This was signed in August 2000 to address Burundi's civil war, which erupted in 1993. One of its key provisions gave 60% of government positions to Hutus, who make up about 85% of Burundi's population.

The negotiation process brought together 17 political parties and led to a power-sharing mechanism that provided ethnic quotas in government and the armed forces. These institutions were previously dominated by the Tutsi minority.

The civil war, which ended in 2005, pitted Burundi's armed forces against Hutu rebel movements. Burundi's current ruling party, the National Council for the Defence of Democracy-Forces for the Defense of Democracy, was one of these Hutu rebel movements.

RED-Tabara is an offspring of the banned political party Movement for Solidarity and Democracy. The party was banned in 2017 after its members were accused of inciting violence.

It's led by former journalist Alexis Sinduhije, who previously used the media to promote peace during the civil war. Since joining politics, however, Sinduhije has been sanctioned by, among others, the US for his turn to violence. RED-Tabara is, therefore, viewed as the military wing of Sinduhije's political party.

The Rwanda factor

The Burundi government has linked RED-Tabara's recent operations and attacks to Rwandan support. Burundi accuses Kigali of using the group to support the country's destabilisation in two major ways.

First, after the failed military coup against Nkurunziza in 2015, coup leaders who were not arrested fled and found exile in Rwanda. They have since made statements from Kigali aimed at delegitimatising the Burundian government.

Read more: East Africa's peace mission in the DRC: why it's in Burundi's interest to help

Second, there have been reports that Kigali was recruiting and training Burundian rebels from the Mahama Refugee Camp in eastern Rwanda. The site hosts more than 60,000 refugees, a majority of whom are from Burundi.

In 2016, UN experts interviewed captured Burundian fighters in the DRC. These fighters claimed they were recruited from the Mahama camp and, after being trained, were escorted by Rwandan military personnel into the DRC with fake IDs as Congolese citizens. They then moved to South Kivu, ready to launch attacks against the Burundi government as members of RED-Tabara.

The presence of former coup leaders in Rwanda and their involvement in destabilising actions against the Burundi government, as well as the seemingly renewed support for RED-Tabara fighters from the Rwandan government, are driving the renewed political tensions between Kigali and Gitega.

Conflict dynamics

RED-Tabara's attacks fit into the complex conflict dynamics in the Great Lakes region.

The DRC has become the site of proxy wars, as competing political and economic interests from its neighbours conflate.

About 1,000 Burundian troops are supporting the Congolese army's fight against a fast-advancing M23 rebel group in the country's eastern region. Rwanda has been accused by the UN of financing the M23 - allegations that Kigali has denied.

Against this backdrop, Rwandan support of RED-Tabara fighters can be seen as an effort to undermine Burundi's military support in the DRC. This view is supported by Kigali's continued refusal to hand over Burundians who plotted the 2015 coup, and continue to live in Rwanda while coordinating attacks in Burundi.

This has widened the fault lines between Burundi and Rwanda, and could rope in other countries in the region.

Amid these realignments, RED-Tabara is emerging as an armed group that has chosen terror as its main tactic. This, in turn, has resulted in the movement being perceived as losing its initial vision.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Burundi’s internal affairs minister on Thursday announced the country was suspending diplomatic ties with Rwanda, closing their border and deporting Rwandan citizens, claiming it was a response to its neighbor’s alleged support for a rebel group that has been attacking Burundi.

“(Rwandan President) Paul Kagame is a bad neighbor ... We have suspended all relations with him until he comes to his senses. He is harboring criminals who are destabilizing Burundi,” Internal Affairs Minister Martin Niteretse said while meeting with security officials in Kayanza province near the Rwandan border.

The minister said Burundi’s government had started deporting Rwandan nationals. “All the borders are closed. We don’t need Rwandans here, and even those who were on our territory, we chased them out,” he said.

The suspension of relations comes after a speech last month by Burundi’s President Évariste Ndayishimiye, who accused Rwanda of backing Burundian rebels known as RED-Tabara, which Burundi considers a terror group. The rebels claimed responsibility for a Dec. 22 attack that it said killed 10 security officials. The government said 20 people were killed, the majority of them civilians.

Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo said in a statement that Burundi’s decision was unfortunate and violates the East African Community’s principles of regional cooperation. Rwanda has previously denied backing the rebels.

On Thursday, a Burundian manager for a bus company said police were turning back their vehicles coming from Rwanda at the Gasenyi-Nemba border crossing. The manager spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

Révérien Burikukiye, who distributes food products between the two countries, said several Rwandans who use the Ruhwa border crossing were blocked while trying to return home, along with Burundians who had gone to a market in Rwanda.

“We are neighbors, our only concern is to live in harmony with the Rwandans,” Burikukiye said. “If the leaders have differences, let them resolve them without making us suffer.”

This is not the first time Burundi has closed its border with Rwanda. It closed them in 2015 during political violence in Burundi that followed the disputed reelection of then-President Pierre Nkurunziza. Burundian authorities accused Rwanda of supporting the protesters and welcoming the perpetrators of a failed coup. The border reopened in 2022.

The RED-Tabara rebel group first appeared in 2011 and has been accused of a string of attacks in Burundi since 2015. It is believed to be based in eastern Congo.

From the hills at Kiriri, to the east of Burundi's capital Bujumbura, there is a clear view of Lake Tanganyika. The Itombwe Mountains across the water in the Democratic Republic of Congo are harder to see as low hanging clouds always get in the way. It is a picture of tranquillity.

Traffic is light, people are on the streets, but peer closer and you will see cracks in the serenity.

Residents of the city say since "Le Crise" - or the crisis - began in April, more razor wire barriers line certain streets and soldiers are constantly on patrol throughout the city.

The United Nations is concerned, beginning plans to send in a rapid reaction force if needed.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — At least 20 people have been killed in Burundi following an attack by a rebel group based in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, a Burundian government spokesman said Saturday.

Among those killed were 12 children and three women, two of whom were pregnant, spokesman Jérôme Niyonzima said in a statement.

The attack targeted nine homes on Friday evening in the western town of Vugizo, close to the Lake Tanganyika border with Congo, according to the Burundian government.

RED-Tabara, a Burundian armed rebel group based in South Kivu, eastern Congo, claimed responsibility for the attack in a post on X, formerly Twitter. The group, which denied having targeted civilians, claimed to have killed nine soldiers and a police officer.

Burundian authorities consider RED-Tabara a terrorist movement. The group first appeared in 2011 and has been accused of a string of attacks in Burundi since 2015.

Witnesses who spoke to The Associated Press said the rebels appeared to be wearing Burundian army uniform and civilians were “left to their own devices” after the military and police fled.

“We realized they were attackers when they attacked the police position guarding the border,” said Priscille Kanyange, a farmer. “Many people here were injured by bullets (as they were) trying to flee.”

Farmer Innocent Hajayandi, who witnessed the attack said security forces fled, “leaving the residents to their own devices.”

André Kabura a grocery shop owner, who was wounded in both legs by gunfire, said the military and police were slow to regroup and fend off the attackers.

On Friday, Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye told army, police and intelligence officers to remain vigilant, warning that “the enemy never sleeps even if we have security.”

In August last year, Burundi deployed soldiers to eastern Congo as part of a regional force invited by Congo to tackle the resurgence of the M23 rebel group there. Some observers believed that the Burundi troops from the seven-nation East African Community force would be used to crush RED-Tabara.

However, the East African Regional force is currently being withdrawn in phases from the violence-plagued eastern Congo following complaints from locals and authorities that instead of disarming the rebels, the forces were cohabiting with them.

The Burundi Human Rights Initiative said Burundi had secretly deployed hundreds of troops and militia to Congo in 2021 to fight RED-Tabara. The impact of that secret deployment is not clear.

Burundi is grappling with a growing crisis as landslides intensify, sparking alarm in both the economic capital, Bujumbura, and the surrounding provinces. The western part of the city has already witnessed the collapse of several houses, instilling fear among residents along the Ntahangwa River.

Pelagie Niyukuri, a resident, expresses gratitude for being alive amid the precarious ravine. During rains, panic ensues as residents fear a potential collapse, leading to a perilous plunge into the Ntahangwa. About sixty kilometers away in Cibitoke, the same phenomenon is causing panic, with landslides engulfing hectares of crops and homes.

Mathias Karikuriyo, a resident of Rusiga, voices the collective terror, fearing burial beneath nightly landslides. The plea to the government is desperate, urging relocation to ensure the safety of families and children.

The escalating landslides pose a deeply concerning challenge for the government. Saidi Anicet, Chief of Staff of the Governor of Cibitoke, emphasizes the need to prioritize saving the population. Urgent action is required, including the relocation of communities from dangerous areas to prevent mass exodus from collapsing lands.

To address this phenomenon, environmentalists propose a natural stabilization approach as a crucial first step. Leonard Nibigira, an environmental expert, advocates for the selection of stabilizing crops or plants. Bamboo, in particular, emerges as an effective choice due to its negligible weight and extensive root system, aiding in soil stabilization and enhancing cohesion.

The scars of 2019 resurface as landslides in the Mugina commune, Cibitoke province, resulted in over 24 fatalities, 7 injuries, and more than 30 people missing. The region also suffered significant material damage, underscoring the urgent need for proactive measures.

The trouble began in April when it was announced that President Nkurunziza would run for a third term.

Protesters took to the streets saying the former rebel leader, who has been in power for nearly 10 years, was not entitled to do so.

They are unhappy that the constitutional court ruled that as Mr Nkurunziza was appointed by parliament in 2005 - and not directly elected - he could stand again.

Some army generals agreed that this flew in the face of the peace accord that ended a brutal 12-year civil war - and said they had relieved the president of his duties.

The rights group says authorities have responded to attacks nationwide with a heavy-handed approach.

Burundi’s security agencies have committed violations against people suspected of belonging to opposition parties or of working with armed opposition groups, according to Human Rights Watch.

In a report published on Wednesday, the United States-based rights group said national intelligence services, police, and governing party youth members have responded to attacks on both civilians and state agents in the country with a heavy-handed approach.

The HRW said the authorities have shown little regard for credible investigations, objective evidence, or due process needed to hold those actually responsible for the attacks, to account.

“Instead of targeting perceived opponents, President Evariste Ndayishimiye’s administration should focus on bringing those responsible for abuse to justice, including members of the security forces,” said Clémentine de Montjoye, Africa researcher at HRW.

“Burundians will only stop living in fear when their tormentors are held to account,” she added.

HRW said it interviewed more than 30 people, including victims and witnesses of violations, family members, opposition party representatives, and Burundian human rights defenders between October 2021 and April 2022.

The rights group said it also analysed and authenticated footage showing several army and police officers admitting to killings and reviewed the reports of local and international human rights organisations, media reports, public speeches of government officials, and social media posts.

EU, US criticised

The rights group criticised the European Union, the United States and other countries for pursuing a policy of rapprochement with the Burundi authorities despite overwhelming evidence of rights abuses.

“Governments and regional and international institutions engaging with Burundi should ensure that serious human rights violations … are on the agenda and that concrete and measurable actions are proposed to address them,” HRW said.

It called on the government to publicly condemn human rights violations, and conduct transparent investigations to hold suspects accountable.

The HRW also said armed groups in Burundi should cease committing human rights abuses and acts of violence against state agents and civilians.

In 2015, Burundi’s then-President Pierre Nkurunziza sought to change the constitution to hand himself a third term. He faced significant internal and external political opposition – including a failed coup attempt.

His government responded by unleashing a wave of political violence, persecution and human rights violations against real and perceived opponents. Burundi was sent into a tailspin of violent clashes, and political and economic uncertainty.

Since then, the EU and the US first imposed visa restrictions on the perpetrators of the violence. Wide-ranging economic sanctions soon followed in response to Nkurunziza’s destructive actions.

Burundi shuts borders with 'bad neighbour' Rwanda

11 January 2024 Share Save Prime Ndikumagenge BBC Great Lakes Share Save

BBC Mr Ndayishimiye (L) accused Mr Kagame (R) of hosting and training the rebels

Burundi has closed its borders with Rwanda after accusing its neighbour of funding rebel attacks.

Last December Red Tabara, a Burundian rebel group, killed 20 people near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Rwandan President Paul Kagame denies the charge, but Burundi's government has branded him a "bad neighbour".

"We have stopped ties with him until he changes," said Burundi's Interior Minister Martin Niteretse.

Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye made the accusation in December following the attack.

The Rwandan government responded that it "regrets the unilateral closure of the border by Burundi", according to AFP.

It said the border closure was an "unfortunate decision" which violated the principles of regional cooperation and the integration of the East Africa Community.

Red Tabara admitted to carrying out the December attack, but said they had only killed nine soldiers and one police officer.

The group operates from DR Congo's South Kivu province bordering Burundi.

It was not immediately clear whether the border closure included both land and air.

In 2015 Burundi closed its border to Rwanda due to political tensions and then because of Covid-19. Seven years later the borders reopened.

During that time land crossings were not permitted. But the airline carrier RwandAir never stopped its commercial flights to Burundi.

Relations between Rwanda and Burundi have been tenuous despite their having a similar language, ethnic composition and colonial history.

International Criminal Court probes Burundi 'crimes against humanity'

9 November 2017 Share Save Share Save

AFP/Getty The decision was made on October the 25th - two days before Burundi's official withdrawal from the ICC

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has authorised prosecutors to open a full investigation into alleged crimes against humanity in Burundi.

The announcement comes just weeks after the country became the first member to withdraw from the international court.

Unrest broke out in Burundi in 2015 after President Pierre Nkurunziza decided to run for office a third time.

Rights groups say hundreds of people were killed. UN investigators say there is evidence of crimes against humanity.

They issued a report in September detailing killings, torture and rape, which they say have been committed largely by government forces - but also by opposition groups.

The UN report urged the ICC, based The Hague, to launch an inquiry.

In 2015 security forces launched a crackdown after major protests against President Nkurunziza's decision to stand for re-election. Groups disagreed over whether the candidacy was constitutional.

The ICC statement said hundreds of people had disappeared in the country, and thousands had been illegally detained and tortured.

As many as 400,000 people may have been displaced in the violence, it said.

AFP/GETTY President Nkurunziza has been in power since 2005 and survived an attempted coup in 2015

Burundi withdrew from the ICC on 27 October after accusing the court of deliberately targeting Africans for prosecution. The African Union called for a mass withdrawal of member states in February over the issue.

The decision to approve the investigation was made two days before Burundi's withdrawal but only made public on Thursday to protect witnesses, the ICC said.

But the case of Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir, one of the ICC's "most wanted", has highlighted the difficulty of getting a non-member to co-operate in surrendering suspects.

Responding to news of the ICC case, a senior Burundian presidential spokesperson accused the court of "outrageous lies to implement Westerners' hidden agenda to destabilize Africa".

The country's justice minister, Laurentine Kanyana, called the court's decision a "fraud".

She said her government had no intention of co-operating with the investigation.

(MENAFN- The Peninsula) Xinhua

Nairobi: Kenya, Burundi and Tanzania will receive more rainfall than usual in the coming week, leading to floods, the Climate Prediction and Applications Center (ICPAC) of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a regional bloc, said on Tuesday.

ICPAC said in its latest forecast that the three countries could receive up to 200 mm of rainfall per day. "The expected very heavy rainfall is likely to lead to flooding incidents. Communities in high-risk areas are advised to exercise caution during this period," it said.

The IGAD agency noted that the Greater Horn of Africa region would experience higher temperatures of up to 32 degrees Celsius during this period.

The most affected countries are expected to include South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan, according to ICPAC.

ICPAC recently forecasted that between March and May, the Greater Horn of Africa countries would experience below-normal rainfall as the region bears the brunt of climate variability.

Up to 67 million people in the region are food insecure due to conflict and climate shocks, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and IGAD.

Deadly floods are wreaking havoc in many parts of East Africa with Burundi calling for international help to deal with the aftermath of torrential rainfall.

Over the weekend, the country's government began the voluntary relocation of approximately 2000 families displaced by the flooding, moving them to shelters on higher ground.

"We thought the state had abandoned us. Thank goodness for that slight improvement, to have a place to rest," said Ndaba Minani who says he has been displaced by floods for the past four years with a leg injury that has left him disabled.

Displaced families boarded buses provided by the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and moved from the shores of Gutumba in the west of the country near the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo to Matyazo, some 30 kilometres (19 miles) from the economic capital, Bujumbura.

The relocation is mired with logistical challenges, including a shortage of materials used for makeshift shelters to house displaced families.

Lake Tanganyika’s rising waters have flooded various parts of the country including Bujumbura, disrupting business there and elsewhere in the country that relies heavily on donor support to run government programs.

The Boulevard du Japon, a major highway in Bujumbura, has been flooded in recent days.

Between September and April 7, some 203,944 people were affected by flooding, with 19,250 homes and 209 classrooms destroyed.

Burundi is one of the world’s poorest countries, with 80% of its 13 million people employed in agriculture, according to the World Bank.

Flooding there has created surreal scenes like game rangers entering the waterlogged Rusizi National Park in a canoe.

Climate experts say flooding in Burundi and elsewhere in the region is part of extreme conditions linked to the El Niño weather phenomenon.

People in Burundi are struggling to cope with flooding after months of heavy rains, with hundreds of thousands being displaced and many homes and schools damaged.

The relentless rain has resulted in the level of water in Lake Tanganyika rising considerably, causing chaos for communities living along its shores.

Lake Tanganyika’s rising waters have invaded the port of Bujumbura, Burundi’s economic capital, disrupting business there and elsewhere in the country

“The economic impacts are starting to weigh heavily. But why these floods? It must be said that they are associated with the climate changes that are affecting Burundi, like other countries in the region,” says Jean-Marie Sabushimike, a disaster management expert and professor of geography at Burundi University.

While climate change is the trigger, the impact of the flooding is exacerbated by poor land-use planning “that does not take into account areas at very high risk of flooding,” he said.

The United Nations estimates that, since September, over 200,000 people have been displaced by flooding as a consequence of the El Nino weather phenomenon.

Many people are living in difficult situations as the water has destroyed infrastructure, flooded fields, and impacted livelihoods.

“Since last year, the rain and the water levels have been rising here. Little by little, the land is getting waterlogged. Now, it has reached this level and we have never seen it this bad. It's terrible,” says flood victim, Joachim Ntirampeba.

With forecasts predicting above normal rainfall until May, the government has appealed to the international community for financial assistance to deal with the impact of flooding.

“We are asking our development partners to combine efforts with the state of Burundi to help all people affected by these disasters,” said Interior Minister Martin Niteretse.

Twenty people, including 19 civilians, were killed in western Burundi, the government announced on Saturday, in an attack claimed by the RED-Tabara rebel group, which in turn claimed to have killed ten members of the security forces.

The attack was carried out on Friday evening in the locality of Vugizo, some twenty kilometers from the economic capital Bujumbura and bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the country where the rear base of the RED-Tabara movement (Resistance for the Rule of Law in Burundi), the main armed group fighting the regime led by Evariste Ndayishimiye, is located.

In a statement, the government claims that this "cowardly attack" deliberately targeted civilians, killing a total of 20 people, including "12 children, including five under the age of five; three women, two of whom were pregnant; and five men, including one of the police officers who intervened to rescue the civilians".

Nine others were injured and hospitalized, the government added, condemning a "despicable and barbaric terrorist act".

The RED-Tabara group claimed that its "fighters (...) based in Burundi attacked the Vugizo border post" and asserted that "9 soldiers and 1 policeman were killed", in a message on "X" (ex-Twitter).

Two military and security sources told AFP that the attack had targeted a "military position".

"Civilians were caught in the crossfire and killed, then the attackers retreated into the DRC," a senior army officer, who requested anonymity, told AFP, confirming a death toll of 20.

This was the second action in less than two weeks by these rebels on Burundian soil, where they had not been active since attacks in September 2021, one of which targeted Bujumbura airport.

On December 11, they reported clashes with soldiers in north-western Burundi.

"The RED-Tabara movement promises to continue its operations throughout the country", they wrote on "X".

Since late 2021, their fighting had been concentrated in the DRC's South Kivu province, where Burundian forces had been sent to hunt them down, according to Congolese and Burundian sources.

The authorities in Kinshasa and Gitega have always denied this presence.

In a report published in July, the NGO Initiative pour les droits humains au Burundi (IDHB) claimed that hundreds of Burundian soldiers and militiamen had been secretly sent to the eastern DRC as early as December 2021.

A thousand soldiers have also been officially deployed to North Kivu as part of an East African Community (EAC) force to be deployed from November 2022. They withdrew on December 11, after the mission of this regional force was not renewed.

Created in 2011 and with an estimated strength of between 500 and 800 men, RED-Tabara is accused of being responsible for most of the deadly attacks and ambushes in Burundi since 2015.

KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) — Rwandan authorities accused Burundi’s leader of making “incendiary allegations aimed at inciting division among Rwandans,” raising tensions that persist after Burundi closed all border crossings with Rwanda earlier this month.

Relations between Rwanda and Burundi have deteriorated in recent weeks after Burundian President Evariste Ndayishimiye renewed accusations that Rwanda is funding and training the rebels of the RED-Tabara group.

Burundian authorities consider RED-Tabara a terrorist movement and accuse its members of being part of a failed coup attempt in 2015. The group first appeared in 2011 and has been accused of a string of attacks in Burundi since 2015.

Ndayishimiye spoke of Rwandan youth in “captivity” at an event in the Congolese capital Kinshasa on Sunday, saying the region needs to continue to fight until Rwandan people put pressure on their own government.

He was addressing a youth conference after attending the inauguration of Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi. He apparently spoke in his other capacity as the African Union Champion for Youth, Peace and Security.

In a statement late Monday, Rwandan authorities described Ndayishimiye’s remarks as “inflammatory,” saying calls for an uprising against the government undermine unity in Rwanda and threaten regional security.

“For anyone to try and undermine this progress by calling on young Rwandans to overthrow their government is troubling. But for a leader of a neighboring country to do so, from an African Union platform, is deeply irresponsible and a flagrant violation of the African Union Charter,” the statement said.

Earlier this month Burundi closed all border crossings with Rwanda and started deporting Rwandan citizens, asserting that it was responding to Rwanda’s alleged support for RED-Tabara. Those rebels attacked the Burundian village of Gatumba near the Congo border last month, killing at least 20 people.

RED-Tabara, which is based in the South Kivu province of eastern Congo, took responsibility for the attack in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

“As long as they have a country that provides them with uniforms, feeds them, protects them, shelters them, maintains them, we will have problems,” Ndayishimiye said in a national radio broadcast last month, referring to RED-Tabara.

Rwanda has repeatedly denied the allegations.

Rwanda and Burundi are both members of the East African Community bloc, whose trade ambitions have suffered in recent years amid sporadic flare-ups that undermine the free movement of people and goods.

Congolese authorities also cite Rwandan aggression in eastern Congo, where government troops are fighting to dislodge the violent M23 rebels who control some territory there. Rwanda denies having authority over M23.

Fizi : clashes between Red-Tabara rebels and the Mai-Mai Yakutumba

On Wednesday, rebels from the armed group of Burundian origin Red-Tabara attacked different posts of the Mai-Mai Yakutumba located in Babengwa in the Lulenge sector and Mondo in the Ngandja sector in the territory of Fizi. It is in the province of South Kivu in the east of the DRC.

INFO SOS Médias Burundi

At the origin of the attacks, the arrest of two young collaborators of Red-Tabara. These two young people are from the Bafulero community. They had been sent to Burundi to escort a woman whose identity and role within the rebellion have not been revealed, according to our sources.

It is another Mai-Mai group that intercepted them. These are the Maï-Maï Hassan Mbakanyi. After their arrest, they were entrusted to the Mai-Mai Yakutumba.

Some humanitarian organizations confirm that many residents of the Bogaragara, Kinyokwe and Kitumba areas have fled the fighting and headed to the Rugezi region.

Congolese people who do not like to see Red-Tabara on their soil

According to the testimony of a Mai-Mai Yakutumba militiaman, “we will fight with Red-Tabara. This group must return to Burundi or Rwanda where it came from.”

Hostilities resumed while last April, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi met with local militias maintained by the Congolese authorities in the east of the country to ask them to “dissociate with foreign armed groups and support the FARDC (Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo).

Based in the province of South Kivu, bordering Burundi, Red-Tabara has often been accused of collaborating with the Mai-Mai Ngomanzito, Bilozebishambuke, René and Ilunga. Reports from UN experts say the coalition is pillaging livestock, burning entire villages and killing civilians, especially from the Banyamulenge community in the areas of Bijombo, Kamombo, Rurambo, Minembwe and Kabara.

The rebel movement considered as a terrorist group by Burundian authorities and whose attacks are among other things at the origin of the deterioration of relations between Rwanda and Burundi, has always denied these allegations, calling them “rumors aimed at tarnishing its image “.

According to information not yet verified by SOS Médias Burundi, the Red-Tabara rebels invaded a Mai-Mai Yakutumba camp in Babengwa, recovering many weapons and ammunition on Thursday.

The Red-Tabara guest from Burundi is also detained by the Mai-Mai Yakutumba, according to witnesses.

ADF STAFF

Just a few kilometers from one of the world’s most deadly hotspots for militant violence — the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) — the people of Burundi are struggling with an insurgency of their own.

Increasing attacks by the RED-Tabara rebel group have revealed a pattern of killing civilians and claiming credit for the attacks on social media but denying civilians were involved. The offensive has elicited outrage from a broad spectrum of Burundians.

“The government of Burundi once again deplores the behavior of Rwanda which maintains, trains and arms the terrorist group RED-Tabara,” government spokesman Jérôme Niyonzima said in a February 26 statement.

The night before, gunmen crossed the border from the DRC and stormed the town of Buringa, just a couple of kilometers north of Burundi’s largest city, Bujumbura. They killed nine people, including six women and one Soldier, and injured five.

Rockets hit the local headquarters of the CNDD-FDD political party, leaving its brick walls, wooden A-frame roof and corrugated metal sheets shredded. The Soldier was inside the building, according to weekly newspaper Iwacu.

“Recently, a similar case took place in Gatumba now it is Buringa’s turn,” Sixte-Vigny Nimuraba, president of the Independent National Commission on Human Rights, told Iwacu. “I can only condemn such a despicable act which aims to assassinate the civilian population. Our law enforcement agencies must review their strategies for protecting the population.”

The rebel group said on social media that it had attacked two Burundian military positions, killing six Soldiers and seizing weapons and ammunition.

In late December, 12 children were among the 20 civilians killed by RED-Tabara fighters in Gatumba. The rebel group claimed on social media to have killed nine Soldiers and a police officer in the attack. It continues to deny that it targets civilians.

RED-Tabara, a French acronym for the Resistance for Rule of Law in Burundi (Résistance pour un État de Droit au Burundi), has been fighting to topple Burundi’s government from bases in the South Kivu region of eastern DRC since 2015.

The most active of a handful of rebel groups seeking to unseat the Burundi government, RED-Tabara is estimated to have 500 to 800 fighters.

University of Pretoria researcher Patrick Hajayandi connects the armed group to Burundi’s failed military coup in 2015. The putschists who were not arrested fled north to Rwanda.

“The presence of former coup leaders in Rwanda and their involvement in destabilizing actions against the Burundi government, as well as the seemingly renewed support for RED-Tabara fighters from the Rwandan government, are driving the renewed political tensions between Kigali and Gitega,” he wrote in an April 14 article for The Conversation Africa magazine.

Shortly after the Gatumba attack, Burundian President Evariste Ndayishimiye accused Rwanda of hosting and training RED-Tabara. Despite Rwanda’s denials, Burundi later closed its border with Rwanda, suspended diplomatic relations and deported several Rwandan citizens.

Hajayandi noted reports that Rwanda was recruiting and training Burundian rebels from the Mahama Refugee Camp in eastern Rwanda, which houses more than 60,000 refugees, a majority of whom are from Burundi.

United Nations experts who interviewed captured fighters in the DRC reported in 2016 that RED-Tabara members said they were recruited, trained and escorted by Rwandan military personnel into the DRC with fake IDs as Congolese citizens.

The recent spate of attacks by RED-Tabara increasingly look more like terrorism than political violence, according to Hajayandi. He believes the Burundian rebels are similar to the extremist Congolese M23 group in that they are both fighting proxy wars on behalf of Rwanda.

“[RED-Tabara] claims to fight for a return to the rule of law, which it claims the current government has abandoned,” he wrote. “However, its indiscriminate attacks against civilian populations are increasingly falling into the pattern of terror acts.

“Over the past 15 years, I have studied the conflict dynamics in the Great Lakes region. In my view, the RED-Tabara attacks are part of coordinated actions to use conflict to reshape the region’s geopolitics.”

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Rwanda has denied claims by neighboring Burundi that it armed a rebel group that was accused of carrying out a grenade attack, as relations between the two countries continue to be strained.

“We call on Burundi to solve its own internal problems and not associate Rwanda with such despicable matters,” government spokesperson Yolande Makolo said in a statement Sunday.

Burundi’s interior ministry blamed the grenade attack on Friday that injured 38 people on RED-Tabara rebels and said the group was backed by Rwanda. The rebel group denied responsibility for the attack.

Relations between Rwanda and Burundi have deteriorated since early this year when Burundian President Evariste Ndayishimiye renewed accusations that Rwanda was funding and training the RED-Tabara rebels, who oppose the Burundi government.

Burundian authorities consider RED-Tabara a terrorist movement and accuse its members of being part of a failed coup attempt in 2015. The group first appeared in 2011 and has been accused of a string of attacks in Burundi since 2015.

In January, the Rwandan government accused Burundi of closing the border between the two countries, two weeks after an attack that Burundi said was carried out by the RED-Tabara group.

Uvira: new clashes between Red-Tabara rebels and the FDNB

New hostilities broke out between the Burundian Red-Tabara rebels and the FDNB (Burundi National Defense Force) between December 5 and 7. The rebels announced that they had recovered several positions of the Burundian army and its allies.

INFO SOS Médias Burundi

The fighting took place in Tabunde. It is in the Lulenge sector, in Fizi territory in the province of South Kivu, eastern Congo. In these clashes, the Burundian army was supported by the Mayi-Mayi Yakutumba and the FARDC (Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo), according to our sources.

The rebels said they had attacked the Burundian army, taken control of their positions and recovered several weapons and ammunition.

Residents confirmed to SOS Médias Burundi that the FDNB elements deserted their camps in Tabunde, Kabundabwami, Lubwebwe and Mutanoga.

“They retreated towards

Kabanju, Kuku and Malinge in the Lulenge and Itombwe sectors,” they say.

Thousands of residents fled their homes following these hostilities. They headed towards localities considered more secure in the Lulenge sector or the forests, others went to the Itombwe sector.

The Burundian army and its allies had not yet communicated on these new fighting. But a few days ago, a spokesperson for the FDNB had denounced a document from the rebellion that reported the death of several Burundian soldiers in fighting in the same area, including officers.

Spotlight

Although Nkurunziza has suppressed external reporting on Burundi, the country’s 4-year-old political and humanitarian crisis shows no signs of abating.

Mass atrocities and crimes against humanity committed primarily by state agents and their allies continue to take place in Burundi, according to the September 2019 report of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Burundi. The Commission, moreover, found that President Pierre Nkurunziza and many in his inner circle are personally responsible for some of the most serious of these crimes. They include “summary executions, arbitrary arrests and detentions, acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, sexual violence, and forced disappearances.”

The Commission has been investigating the Burundi crisis since 2016. Its findings mirror those of the International Criminal Court, which opened a separate investigation in 2017 based on “a reasonable basis to believe that state agents and groups implementing state policies … launched a widespread and systematic attack against the Burundian civilian population.” The persistence of such atrocities echoes Burundi’s 1972 and 1993 genocides and the brutal civil war that ended in 2005.

A Long Spiral Downward

The adoption of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement in 2000 created a comprehensive peacebuilding framework that, through an inclusive power-sharing formula, addressed the root causes of Burundi’s violent past. The framework ushered in a period of stability and hope, marked by two leadership transitions from President Pierre Buyoya to President Domitien Ndayizeye, each of whom ruled for 18 months before the transition to Nkurunziza in 2005. By this time, Burundi’s traditional political parties were functioning as multiethnic coalitions, marking a break from the divisive politics of the past.

Nkurunziza’s unwillingness to step down following his second term in office in 2015, as stipulated in the Arusha Accords and the 2005 Constitution, reversed this hopeful path and set off the current crisis. His decision to pursue a third term coupled with the resurfacing of the Hutu nationalist agenda of his ruling CNDD-FDD party triggered months of protests and a failed coup attempt in May 2015. It also set off a wave of defections and tit-for-tat violence in the military, targeted killings of civilians—often with ethnic undertones—and the launching of armed rebellions by three separate movements. It is estimated that around 1,700 people have been killed since 2015. The September 2017 Final Report of the UN Independent Investigation on Burundi, however, cautions that “no one can quantify exactly all the violations that have taken place and continue to take place in a situation as closed and repressive as Burundi.”

Despite the information shortage, ample evidence points to a worsening situation under the veneer of calm that the authorities have tried to project. The number of Burundian refugees has exceeded 400,000 (out of a total population of 10 million), making Burundi a “forgotten refugee crisis,” according to Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. At the same time, the state-sponsored militia, the Imbonerakure (“those who see far”), has been implicated in mass atrocities along with the police, intelligence, and elements of the military. Imbonerakure deployments follow a four-tier structure from the colline to the commune, province, and national level, mirroring Burundi’s administrative units. Its members are a major contributing factor of the continuing human displacement, especially in the northern, eastern, and southern provinces, where their presence is particularly entrenched.

The patterns of violence have shifted from overt abuses in 2015 and 2016 to more covert tactics that began at the end of 2016. Firsthand accounts captured in the 2017 UN Commission of Inquiry on Burundi report indicate that atrocities since then have been committed in near-total concealment. Some involve killing victims in one location and dumping their bodies elsewhere, including in neighboring countries, to avoid detection. The 2019 UN report also confirmed numerous secret locations—including residences owned by senior officials—where torture, rape, mutilation, other forms of abuse, and killings occur on a regular basis.

These reports have been corroborated by media stories, local human rights monitors, and the testimony of Imbonerakure defectors. The 2018 Report of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Burundi confirmed the existence of mass graves in the Kanyosha and Mpanda collines of Bujumbura and in Bubanza and other areas. It also corroborated previous findings of lists of civilians and military members marked for execution.

Burundi has also witnessed a surge in disappearances. Since 2015, the United Nations has consistently received reports of forced disappearances in Burundi. Hundreds of cases are investigated and brought to the attention of the Burundi government each quarter. The Ndondeza (“help me find them”) campaign has disseminated more than 400 photos of missing persons since 2015.

Atrocities by state agents are not confined within Burundi’s borders. In 2018, the International Refugee Rights Initiative (IRRI) documented attacks, killings, and disappearances of Burundian refugees at Uganda’s Nakivale refugee camp. Most of the refugees IRRI spoke to said they recognized Burundian intelligence agents and Imbonerakure members, including some who had killed family members in Burundi. IRRI also documented complaints about threatening phone calls and text messages, as well as suspected Imbonerakure agents taking photos in the camp. Members of the Imbonerakure, furthermore, regularly cross the border into Tanzania to surveil and intimidate Burundian refugees in Nyarugusu camp, where most of Burundi’s refugees and exiles live.

Burundi’s self-inflicted political instability has directly impacted living conditions. Its economic growth shrank from 4.2 percent in 2015 to 0.4 percent in 2019 under the weight of high-level corruption and fiscal mismanagement. Since 2017, the government has been unable to pay civil servants on time, a source of public acrimony given that the state employs 80 percent of Burundi’s salaried workers.

Since 2017, the ruling CNDD-FDD has made “contributions” to the Treasury mandatory for every family—a widely unpopular move given the high levels of youth unemployment. Contributing to the economic downturn is a new policy introduced in 2018 that requires foreign aid groups and charities to provide the government with staff lists that identify their employees by ethnicity. Most groups chose to depart rather than comply, further disrupting service delivery.

Burundi’s health sector has been hit particularly hard by the political crisis. Only 500 doctors were still working in Burundi in 2017, according to the UN Children’s Fund. This is roughly half the total present in 2010. The effects are dire: 5.7 million cases of malaria—including 1,801 deaths—were reported in 2019. Those numbers dwarf the 1.8 million infections and 700 deaths reported in 2017, illustrating the progressive deterioration of Burundi’s healthcare system.

While the Region Looks On

The East African Community (EAC) is mandated to mediate the Burundi crisis, but persistent frictions among its members have rendered it ineffective and prolonged the conflict. Of particular concern is the escalating tension between Uganda, the chair of the Burundi Peace Talks, and Rwanda, the EAC chair. A December 2018 UN report found that Burundi, the DRC, and Uganda are now arming and training Rwandan rebels, adding another layer of strain to the already frayed relations between Rwanda and Burundi. A flare-up could have devastating regional consequences.

The AU has been equally ineffective. After abandoning its December 2015 decision to deploy a 5,000-strong protection force, again due to bickering by its members and a threat by the Nkurunziza government to shoot any AU troops entering the country, the AU sent 200 human rights monitors instead. However, they operate under tight restrictions imposed by the government, which largely confine the monitors to Bujumbura. Tellingly, they have never made their reports public due to fears that the Burundi government would expel them. Still, they are the only external monitors in Burundi since the expulsion of the UN Human Rights Commission. The BBC, Voice of America, and virtually all civil society and media organizations have also been forced out.

Six EAC summits failed to persuade the CNDD-FDD to attend talks chaired by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and mediated by former Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa. Five negotiations were held between 2015 and 2018, but none of the talks were face-to-face. The CNDD-FDD instead initiated efforts to revise the 2005 Constitution in ways that dismantled key provisions of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. This was a major blow to the negotiations, given that their core objective was to use the Accords as the basis for resolving the issues that triggered the crisis, stabilizing the country, and preparing it for democratic elections in 2020.

In May 2017, Mkapa presented a fresh road map at the EAC Summit and issued a dire warning: “There is an impasse because the government of Burundi is reluctant to talk to its opponents. Currently, it is picking friendly stakeholders to talk to while ignoring the others.” He also reminded the EAC presidents of the “imperative need” for their “personal engagement” in getting the Burundi government to commit to a serious dialogue without preconditions. Mkapa, moreover, alerted the EAC presidents to the consequences of the CNDD-FDD’s constitutional revision efforts. “Whither the EAC-led mediation whose dialogue I am facilitating? For I fear the region will find itself before a fait accompli.” The Summit adopted the report but failed to convince the Burundi authorities to join.

Passed without a viable opposition in May 2018, Burundi’s new constitution confirms Mkapa’s worst fears. It dismantles two-thirds of the provisions of the Arusha Accords, including the carefully crafted power sharing structure. The Presidency now has the power to overrule Parliament. Moreover, the delicate checks, balances, and quotas that regulated other government branches have been nullified.

This includes the security sector, which has been restructured so as to enable stronger CNDD-FDD control, violating fundamental precepts of military professionalism requiring the independence of militaries from politics. The ruling party had always been deeply suspicious of the Arusha Accords’ quotas, which ensured 50/50 representation of former Hutu movements (including the CNDD-FDD) and the mostly Tutsi ex-Armed Forces of Burundi (ex-FAB). The arrangement had contributed to one of the more effective security sector reform initiatives on the continent. However, since 2015, the CNDD-FDD has pursued an extensive purge of ex-FAB officers, with numerous being killed or abducted. A law introduced in 2017 bestows “reserve force status” on the Imbonerakure and places it within the military, describing it as “citizens militarily trained for this purpose by the Burundi army and veterans.”

As the CNDD-FDD gears up for the 2020 polls, intimidation, disappearances, killings, and ethnic rhetoric are all on the rise. Lost in the Burundi tragedy is the irony that the trigger for the crisis was Nkurunziza’s pursuit of a third term in 2015. While not yet announced, Nkurunziza is expected to run for a fourth term (extended to 7 years under the new constitution) and is entitled to run for a fifth term in 2027. Reflective of the personality-based political structure he has cultivated, Nkurunziza was officially named by his party as “Supreme Eternal Guide” in March 2019.

Reversing Burundi’s Descent

Despite a veneer of stability, Burundi’s crisis rages on, taking a toll on civilian safety, political governance, economic and social development, and overall regional security. As with previous Burundian crises, reversing this downward spiral will require external engagement given the intense distrust and inequities in power domestically. A fresh peace process outside the EAC is needed, given the competing interests within the regional body. It should bring on board a wider group of African and international actors and build on Mkapa’s experience going back to the Arusha peace process. Surviving members of the Mandela and Nyerere mediation teams should also be consulted. The parties to a revamped peace process should involve representatives from all components of Burundi’s political environment, including the domestic and exiled opposition, and not just CNDD-FDD–approved parties.

Foretelling further exclusion, the scheduled 2020 elections are likely to undermine efforts to advance a peace process and should be postponed until a time that they would be jointly supervised by the AU and UN and inspire confidence in ordinary Burundians that the process would be free and fair. Given the CNDD-FDD’s intransigence to negotiate with the opposition, external actors should be prepared to apply additional pressure, including but not limited to targeted sanctions of the CNDD-FDD leadership.

The fact that the Burundi crisis is self-inflicted also means that it can be resolved. Moreover, a roadmap for this resolution, the Arusha Accords, has already been devised. The challenge for external actors is to get the Burundian parties back on that road.

Fizi: new clashes between Mai-Mai and Red-Tabara

The Mai-Mai Yakutumba and Hassan Mbakanyi attacked the Red-Tabara positions in the Ngandja sector on Saturday. It is in the territory of Fizi, in the province of South Kivu in the east of the DRC. The Elders of the Bafulero community asked the Burundian rebels and their allies to withdraw to other areas to avoid attacks by the Burundian army at home.

INFO SOS Médias Burundi

The Burundian rebels of Red-Tabara and their allies, the Maï-Maï Ngomanzito left their bases of Kabanja, Kitumba and Rugezi in the territory of Fizi on Sunday. It was Elders of the Bafulero community who asked them to leave their villages.

“The Elders here fear violent clashes between Burundian soldiers based in the mountains of Ngandja and fighters of Red-Tabara. This is why they begged them to leave our villages, which they did,” say residents from the Ngandja sector.

The day before, several Mai-Mai Yakutumba and Hassan Mbakanyi militiamen had attacked the positions of the Burundian rebels established in the mentioned areas. Local sources say that the Burundian rebels, supported by their allies, the Mai-Mai Ngomanzito, repelled the attacks of their enemies.

According to witnesses, the Red-Tabara rebels and the Mai-Mai Ngomanzito were deployed in the Itombwe sector, Mwenga territory, still in South Kivu.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — At least 20 people have been killed in Burundi following an attack by a rebel group based in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, a Burundian government spokesman said Saturday.

Among those killed were 12 children and three women, two of whom were pregnant, spokesman Jérôme Niyonzima said in a statement.

The attack targeted nine homes on Friday evening in the western town of Vugizo, close to the Lake Tanganyika border with Congo, according to the Burundian government.

RED-Tabara, a Burundian armed rebel group based in South Kivu, eastern Congo, claimed responsibility for the attack in a post on X, formerly Twitter. The group, which denied having targeted civilians, claimed to have killed nine soldiers and a police officer.

Burundian authorities consider RED-Tabara a terrorist movement. The group first appeared in 2011 and has been accused of a string of attacks in Burundi since 2015.

Witnesses who spoke to The Associated Press said the rebels appeared to be wearing Burundian army uniform and civilians were “left to their own devices” after the military and police fled.

“We realized they were attackers when they attacked the police position guarding the border,” said Priscille Kanyange, a farmer. “Many people here were injured by bullets (as they were) trying to flee.”

Farmer Innocent Hajayandi, who witnessed the attack said security forces fled, “leaving the residents to their own devices.”

André Kabura a grocery shop owner, who was wounded in both legs by gunfire, said the military and police were slow to regroup and fend off the attackers.

On Friday, Burundian President Évariste Ndayishimiye told army, police and intelligence officers to remain vigilant, warning that “the enemy never sleeps even if we have security.”

In August last year, Burundi deployed soldiers to eastern Congo as part of a regional force invited by Congo to tackle the resurgence of the M23 rebel group there. Some observers believed that the Burundi troops from the seven-nation East African Community force would be used to crush RED-Tabara.

However, the East African Regional force is currently being withdrawn in phases from the violence-plagued eastern Congo following complaints from locals and authorities that instead of disarming the rebels, the forces were cohabiting with them.

The Burundi Human Rights Initiative said Burundi had secretly deployed hundreds of troops and militia to Congo in 2021 to fight RED-Tabara. The impact of that secret deployment is not clear.

Burundi's president on Friday accused Rwanda of funding and training rebels behind an attack last week on the village of Gatumba, close to Burundi's border with Congo, that killed at least 20 people.

A Burundian armed rebel group known as RED-Tabara and based in South Kivu, eastern Congo, took responsibility for the attack in a post on X, formerly Twitter. The group, which denied having targeted civilians, claimed to have killed nine soldiers and a police officer.

Burundian authorities consider RED-Tabara a terrorist movement. The group first appeared in 2011 and has been accused of a string of attacks in Burundi since 2015.

In a national radio broadcast, President Evariste Ndayishimiye claimed the RED-Tabara "are fed, sheltered, hosted and maintained in terms of logistics and financial means by … Rwanda."

Ndayishimiye said Burundi has been unsuccessfully negotiating with Rwanda for two years, seeking the extradition of the rebels.

"As long as they have a country that provides them with uniforms, feeds them, protects them, shelters them, maintains them, we will have problems," he said.

There was no immediate reaction from Rwanda's government to Ndayishimiye's accusations, but it has previously said that it cannot extradite people who are under the protection of the U.N. refugee agency.

Relations between the two central African neighbors improved with the ascension to power of Ndayishimiye in June 2020, and borders between them reopened.

Some of those killed in the Gatumba attack — which Burundi has described as an act of terror and said it had contacted Interpol to seek its help in apprehending the perpetrators — were buried on Tuesday.

In August last year, Burundi deployed soldiers to eastern Congo as part of a regional force invited by Congo to tackle the resurgence of the M23 rebel group there. Some observers believed that the Burundi troops from the seven-nation East African Community regional force would be used to crush RED-Tabara.

However, the East African force is currently being withdrawn in phases from the violence-plagued eastern Congo following complaints from locals and authorities that instead of disarming the rebels, the forces were cohabiting with them.

BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) — Deadly floods are wreaking havoc in many parts of East Africa that face torrential rainfall, with Burundi calling for international help to deal with the aftermath.

Lake Tanganyika’s rising waters have invaded the port of Bujumbura, Burundi’s economic capital, disrupting business there and elsewhere in the country that relies heavily on donor support to run government programs.

“We are issuing this statement to ask our development partners to combine efforts with the state of Burundi to help all people affected by these disasters,” Interior Minister Martin Niteretse said April 17. “We need that support.”

Between September and April 7, some 203,944 people were affected by flooding, with 19,250 homes and 209 classrooms destroyed. The number of people internally displaced by flooding rose by 25%, reaching over 98,000, according to Violet Kenyana Kakyomya, the U.N. resident coordinator in Burundi.

Burundi is one of the world’s poorest countries, with 80% of its 13 million people employed in agriculture, according to the World Bank.

Flooding there has created surreal scenes like game rangers entering the waterlogged Rusizi National Park in a canoe. The Boulevard du Japon, a major highway in Bujumbura, has been flooded in recent days.

Climate experts say flooding in Burundi and elsewhere in the region is part of extreme conditions linked to the El Niño weather phenomenon.

“It must be said directly that these floods are associated with climate changes that affect Burundi like other countries in the region,” said Jean Marie Sabushimike, a geographer and disaster management expert who teaches at the University of Burundi.

While climate change is the trigger, the impact of the flooding is exacerbated by poor land-use planning “that does not take into account areas at very high risk of flooding,” he said.

The rising waters of Lake Tanganyika have caused the Kanyosha river to overflow, damaging homes and other property in Bujumbura. Some in the city have been unable to return to their homes — or leave.

Joachim Ntirampeba, resident of the village of Gatumba near the Congo border, said that while he had witnessed many flooding events over the years, this time “it’s terrible.”

He said it’s “the first time” he’s seen such heavy flooding.

Meanwhile, in Kenya 35 people have died since mid-March in flooding events that have affected more than 100,000 people, according to the U.N., which cites Red Cross figures in the most recent update.

Some residential areas in Nairobi, the capital, flooded as rivers broke their banks Sunday night.

The Kenyan government agency in charge of roads warned Nairobi residents to avoid flooded highways, including one to the coastal city of Mombasa. Those who live by the Nairobi river were urged to move to higher ground.

Flooding and mudslides have also been reported in western Kenya. In the northern region, a passenger bus was swept away by floodwaters on a bridge earlier in April, with disaster avoided after 51 passengers were rescued.

Kenya’s meteorology department predicts that rainfall will peak this week.

Title: The long road to reconciliation in Burundi

Thirty years after the civil war between the Hutu and Tutsi began in Burundi, nobody has forgotten the atrocities. But the country's current conflict is more political than ethnic.

In the early morning of October 21, 1993, the first brief episode of Hutu rule came to a bloody end in Burundi. Just five months earlier, Melchior Ndadaye had been elected president in the East African country's first democratic vote.

Since Burundi gained independence from Belgium in 1962, a small group of Tutsi militants had divided power among themselves. But, during Pierre Buyoya's term in office, the pressure became too great; he reformed the country's political system, resulting in an electoral victory for the progressive "Hutu party" FRODEBU (Front for Democracy in Burundi) with Ndadaye. This, in turn, attracted radical Tutsis to the scene.

Exactly 30 years ago, Tutsi soldiers stormed the presidential palace, abducting and murdering Ndadaye. The country then descended into a bloody civil war between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebel groups. More than 300,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands fled to neighboring countries.

'Assassination created hatred'

Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu and Burundi's president Nfrom 1994 to 1996, told DW that Ndadaye's "assassination created hatred among Burundians, who turned against each other, and caused a bitter war between them for more than 10 years. The country went backwards economically.”

It was a time of great loss for Burundi, Ntibantunganya said. "Because as far as I know, Melchior Ndadaye was a person who had the determination to fight the extreme poverty in Burundi, and he had solid plans to achieve that, but also to help the Burundians to live together in peace."

Ntibantunganya's term occurred during Burundi's civil war, which begin in and officially ended with the Arusha Accords in 2000, though deep wounds remained. The peace treaty laid the foundation for a comprehensive division of power between the two groups in government, parliament, administration, police and army. A cease-fire followed in 2003, and the ruling National Council for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) party joined the transitional government formed in 2001.

President's unfulfilled promises

The division of power established in the subsequent constitution significantly eased the polarization between Hutu and Tutsi in politics and everyday life. In 2014, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established to address the violence. However, the body's work has come under fire for failing to achieve its mandate, with Amnesty International alleging that is suffers from bias.

Burundi, a country of 11 million inhabitants, has not been free from conflict in its recent history, though it has taken on a different character. Unlike what took place in the 1990s, current disputes are primarily political rather than ethnic in nature. After the violent suppression of protests in 2015 against an unconstitutional third term in office by President Pierre Nkurunziza, Burundi was isolated internationally for a long time, with the opposition and civil society under pressure.

Incumbent President Evariste Ndayishimiye has left repeated promises to ensure justice and promote political tolerance unfulfilled since taking power in 2020. Not only did he appoint ruling party hard-liners to key positions in 2022, but the government is failing in its duty to ensure the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. Meanwhile, suppression of political opponents often results in violent protests.

Human rights violations

Killings, torture, abuse arbitrary arrests and detentions of actual or suspected opposition members were all documented by international and Burundian human rights groups in 2022.

While foreign policy channels have opened up, the human rights situation remains tense, with limited room to maneuver by the political opposition, civil society and the media.

Former President Ntibantunganya believes that Burundi has learned from bitter experiences since the civil war began 30 years ago. The first lesson, he said, has been that many Burundians now understand that there is no path to power but to seek the consent of the people through inclusive, free and fair elections.

The new Burundi?

Ntibantunganya himself was never elected. He ended up in the role of interim president in 1994 after his predecessor Cyprien Ntaryamira and his Rwandan counterpart Juvénal Habyarimana were killed when their plane was shot down in Kigali — the that event marked the beginning of the genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda. In neighboring Burundi to the south, things were comparatively peaceful for a time, but the civil war eventually intensified.

"The second lesson is that Burundians now understand the importance of multipartism, and the role of the independent nongovernmental organization and the media in maintaining the foundations of democracy and the promotion of human rights," Ntibantunganya said. "But the most important lesson is that Burundians are now aware of the importance of dialogue when problems arise between them."

Thirty years ago, Melchior Ndadaye, upon taking office after his election, said to the people: "Peace will be the first priority of the new government that you have elected. ... This new government will say goodbye to harassment, torture, tyranny and murder — the new Burundi."

But Burundi's path toward a stable democracy remains uncertain.

Deserters feared repression over their ethnicity and perceived support of the opposition amid political unrest.

At least 10 officers from Burundi’s army and police force have reportedly fled the country since the beginning of this month amid ongoing repression in the country.

The group includes several senior officers.

Burundian security expert Gratien Rukindikiza put the total number of deserters at 13 and said they had fled owing to fears of repression because of their ethnicity or for being perceived as supporters of the country’s political opposition.

Human rights activists say the Hutu-dominated government of President Pierre Nkurunziza is increasingly repressing ethnic Tutsis.

Burundi has been in turmoil since Nkurunziza announced last year that he would seek a third term in office despite a constitutional two-term limit. His election victory in July 2015 unleashed a wave of political violence in which hundreds have been killed.

In May, a court handed life sentences to 21 people, including senior military officers, who had been implicated in a failed coup attempt against Nkurunziza. Dozens of soldiers have been arrested on charges of supporting the opposition, Rukindikiza, the security expert, said.

Many of the detainees belong to the minority Tutsi ethnic group.

Burundian army spokesman Gaspard Baratuza denied that the deserters had fled owing to ethnic repression or security fears, and said they were being manipulated by the opposition.

Their departure follows that of Colonel Adolphe Manirakiza, a former spokesman for the UN peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic, who fled Burundi in April.

The remains of 6,032 victims as well as thousands of bullets were recovered in six mass graves in Karusi province.

Authorities in Burundi have announced the discovery of more than 6,000 bodies in six mass graves.

The findings in Karusi province are the largest since the government launched a nationwide excavation in January.

Pierre Claver Ndayicariye, chairman of the country’s truth and reconciliation commission, told journalists on Friday that the remains of 6,032 victims, as well as thousands of bullets, were recovered. Clothes, glasses and rosaries were used to identify some of the victims.

Referring to a 1972 massacre which is believed to have targeted people from the Hutu ethnic group, Ndayicariye said families of the victims were able to “break the silence” that was imposed 48 years ago.

The country has suffered colonial occupation, civil war and decades of intermittent massacres.

The government-run commission was set up in 2014 to investigate atrocities from 1885, when foreigners arrived in Burundi, until 2008, when a stalled peace deal to end the civil war was fully implemented.

So far it has mapped over 4,000 mass graves across the country and identified more than 142,000 victims of violence.

Burundi’s population is divided between the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups. Its civil war, which killed 300,000 people before it ended in 2005, had ethnic overtones.

The commission’s mandate does not cover most of the rule of current President Pierre Nkurunziza, who took office in 2005.

In 2015, Nkurunziza’s campaign for a third term plunged the country into violence and led to an enduring political crisis.

In 2018, he surprised observers when he announced he would not seek another term in office, despite a new constitution adopted by referendum allowing him to do so.

The United Nations has warned that human rights abuses may increase again before elections scheduled for May.

The election is meant to usher in the first democratic transition in 58 years of independence for the nation.

Burundians have begun voting in a tense presidential vote, with the election commission calling for a peaceful vote despite simmering political violence and the coronavirus pandemic.

Burundians stood in long lines outside polling stations, which opened shortly after 6am local time (04:00 GMT), to elect not just their new president, but parliamentarians and local councillors, who in turn appoint the members of the Senate.

The election is meant to usher in the first democratic transition in 58 years of independence for the impoverished east African nation.

President Pierre Nkurunziza, whose government has repeatedly been accused of rights abuses, will step down after 15 years. His ruling National Council for the Defense of Democracy – Forces for the Defense of Democracy (CNDD-FDD) party candidate, retired army general Evariste Ndayishimiye, is running against opposition leader Agathon Rwasa and five others.

“We call on Burundians to massively go to vote and vote peacefully. We need good elections,” Pierre Claver Kazihise, chairman for the election commission, known as CENI, said in comments aired by state broadcaster RTNB.

“The voter is asked to leave after casting their ballot. No gatherings are allowed near polling stations.”

Each booth has a blue ballot box for the presidential election, a green one for the legislative and red for the local.

The government has refused any observers from the United Nations or the African Union, accusing the latter of being too close to the opposition.

Social networks had been shut down from at least one hour before voting began, with access only possible via a virtual private

2015 elections

There was widespread international criticism of Burundi’s last election in 2015, when Nkurunziza ran for a third term.

His opponents said his participation violated a peace deal that ended the civil war and boycotted the poll.

The election sparked violent protests that drove hundreds of thousands of Burundians into exile.

The UN documented hundreds of killings as well as the torture and gang rape of opposition activists. Donors withdrew funding in protest.

The government denies accusations of rights violations.

Rwasa, like Nkurunziza a former rebel leader, warned of possible electoral fraud in his final rally on Sunday.

“We know there is plan of election fraud, some are even intimidating people asking for their voter cards to vote for them,” he said. “All of that is worthless.”

The United Nations and the African Union said in a joint statement on Sunday they remained “concerned about reports of intimidation and violent clashes between supporters of opposing sides”.

There will be few election monitors after the government said they would have to spend 14 days in quarantine to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.

The government expelled the national head of the World Health Organization (WHO) last week following public criticism that all parties were holding rallies despite the disease.

The country of 11 million people has reported only 42 coronavirus cases and one death.

Testing remains very low, however, with only 633 tests carried out, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

Latest OCHA report suggests almost half of Burundi’s entire population has been affected by the disease this year.

Malaria has killed more than 1,800 people in Burundi this year, the United Nations humanitarian agency has said, a death toll rivalling an Ebola outbreak in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo.

In its latest situation report, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said 5.7 million cases of malaria had been recorded in Burundi in 2019 – a figure roughly equal to half its entire population.

Of those cases, a total of 1,801 died from the mosquito-born disease in Burundi between January 1 and July 21, OCHA said.

The tiny country of 11 million people in the African Great Lakes region has still not declared a national emergency, despite OCHA saying the outbreak crossed “epidemic proportions” in May.

“The national malaria outbreak response plan, which is currently being validated, has highlighted a lack of human, logistical and financial resources for effective response,” OCHA said in its latest weekly bulletin on humanitarian emergencies.

“All stakeholders, including the national authorities and partners are called upon to provide the requisite resources to mount a robust response to this event before it escalates.”

A lack of preventive measures such as mosquito nets, climatic changes and increased movements of people from mountain areas with low immunity to malaria were driving the crisis, OCHA said.

‘Many crises’

An OCHA official told AFP news agency that “the decision to declare an epidemic is the sovereignty of the Burundian state”.

The country declared a malaria epidemic in March 2017, when it had recorded 1.8 million cases and 700 deaths, but was resisting doing the same now.

A senior government official, who declined to be named, said the government did not want to admit weakness with elections set for 2020.

190723082343305

“We are less than a year away from the presidential election. [President Pierre] Nkurunziza, who is facing many crises, does not want to recognise what could be considered a failure of his health policy,” the official told AFP.

In 2015, Nkurunziza ran for a third term and was reelected in elections boycotted by most of the opposition.

At least 1,200 people were killed and more than 400,000 displaced in violence the UN says was mostly carried out by state security forces.

Nkurunziza announced in 2018 that he would not stand again, confounding critics who accused him of working to extend his grip on power.

UN investigators said in July that “drastic” steps were needed to boost democratic freedoms in Burundi if the government wanted the elections to be considered credible.

Burundi, one of the poorest countries in the region, borders the DRC, where the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history has killed more than 1,800 people amid fears the infectious fever could spread beyond its borders.

But malaria is a much bigger killer in the continent.

The World Health Organization recorded nearly 220 million cases of the parasitic illness in 2017, with an estimated 435,000 deaths worldwide.

More than 90 percent of malaria cases and deaths were in Africa.

Influx of 40,000 fleeing Congo war worsens Burundi humanitarian plight, UN says

Audio By Carbonatix

By Olivia Le Poidevin

GENEVA (Reuters) – Burundi is facing a rapidly worsening humanitarian situation as more than 40,000 people have fled there in two weeks to escape fighting in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, the U.N. said on Friday.

“Last week more than 9,000 people crossed in one day … This is the first time Burundi has received this large number of people”, Brigitte Mukanga-eno, UNHCR Representative in Burundi, told reporters in Geneva via video link.

The M23 advance is the gravest escalation in more than a decade of the long-running conflict in eastern Congo, rooted in the spillover of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide into Congo and the struggle for control of Congo’s vast mineral resources.

Rwanda rejects allegations by Congo, the United Nations and Western powers that it supports M23 with arms and troops. It says it is defending itself against the threat from a Hutu militia, which it says is fighting with the Congolese military.

Several areas in northwest Burundi are overwhelmed with people, some of whom have been displaced several times and have arrived injured or with health problems such as measles, according to the U.N.

The U.N. representative recounted the story of a woman whose two children died from exhaustion shortly after arriving across the border into Burundi.

U.N. refugee agency UNHCR says 36,000 people have fled to Burundi, some on makeshift boats across the Rusizi river separating the two countries, while 6,000 have entered via the official border crossing of Bujumbura since February 14.

“The escalating situation in the DRC has had a big impact on Burundi. Over the past few weeks we have observed large number of Congolese who have been crossing into Burundi”, Mukanga-eno said.

UNHCR plans to move the displaced, who are being temporarily housed in an open air stadium as well as schools and churches, to an area of land where humanitarian care can be provided.

The agency has launched an emergency appeal for $40.4 million to provide lifesaving help to support the potential influx of 258,000 refugees into Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia.

Burundi has had its own soldiers in eastern Congo for years, initially to hunt down Burundian rebels there, but more recently, to aid in the fight against M23.

Rwanda claims the expulsions were part of crackdowns on those living illegally in the country.

Rwanda has expelled more than 1,500 Burundians in the past week after they refused to move to refugee camps, according to Burundian officials.

Monday’s move is the latest sign that a political crisis is testing the already tense relations between the neighbouring central African countries.

Seraphine Mukantabana, Rwandan minister of disaster management and refugee affairs, said on Monday that the expulsions were part of regular crackdowns on those living illegally in the country and were not targeting Burundians specifically.

“We had a number of Burundians scattered across the country who had no documents,” she said.

Rwanda has been hosting tens of thousands of people who have fled more than a year of political violence in Burundi and others who have been there for work, often without formal permission.

“They were asked to go to refugee camps or return back to Burundi,” the governor of Burundi’s Kirundo province next to the Rwandan border, Melchior Nankwahomba, told the Reuters news agency.

“Those who refused to go to refugee camps were chased … and stripped of their possessions,” he said, adding that they were pushed out by local officials.

Flow of expelled Burundians

Philippe Ngabonziza, mayor of the Burundian town of Ntega, said 1,320 expelled Burundians had arrived since Friday.

The governor of the neighbouring Ngozi district, Albert Nduwimana, said they had received 218 people over the weekend.

The crackdown on Burundians follows the expulsion of thousands of Rwandans by Burundi since April 2015.

Burundi has been in political crisis since then, after President Pierre Nkurunziza controversially decided to run for a third term which he went on to win in a July election.

Hundreds have been killed and more than 200,000 have fled Burundi, according to the United Nations, raising fears of a return to the civil war fought between 1993 and 2006.

Burundi has accused Rwanda of interfering in its political crisis, which has seen Burundian government forces clash with protesters and rebels who say the president violated the constitution by standing another term. Rwanda has denied Burundi’s accusations.

Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.

History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at archiveteam.org and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the Wayback Machine, providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

The Archive Team Panic Downloads are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

UN probe team draws up lists of suspects behind alleged human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity.

Burundi’s government is behind systematic human rights abuses, including executions and torture, a new report by UN investigators has said, adding that some instances of these “gross human rights violations amount to crimes against humanity”.

Responding to Tuesday’s report, Burundi accused the United Nations of bias, saying its investigators were “politically motivated” and their conclusions based on anonymous and unverifiable sources.

Some instances of these gross human rights violations amount to crimes against humanity by UN report

The three independent investigators were tasked by the UN Human Rights Council in January with investigating rights abuses in Burundi since it descended into violence in April 2015 over President Pierre Nkurunziza’s controversial decision to run for a third term – a vote he won in July of the same year.

The report by the UN Independent Investigation on Burundi (UNIIB) said that “gross human rights violations have and are taking place, committed primarily by state agents and those linked to them”.

The UN human rights office has verified 564 cases of executions between April 26, 2015, and August 30, 2016, the investigators, who made two trips to Burundi and conducted 227 interviews, said.

They added that this was “clearly a conservative estimate”.

A list of suspects will be handed to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and be available in the event of any prosecutions, the investigators said.

The government denied all the allegations.

“@UNHumanRights did not respect the usual rules by releasing the report without the response of @BurundiGov,” the president’s communications chief Willy Nyamitwe tweeted.

The government has sent the UN rights commissioner a 40-page rebuttal, he added.

Death-lists

The investigators said that they had received evidence of rape, disappearances, mass arrests as well as torture and murder, and that there were probably many thousands of victims.

“UNIIB found that the large majority of victims have been identified as people who were opposed or perceived to be opposed to the third mandate of President Nkurunziza or of members of opposition parties,” it said.

UNIIB said a former senior army officer told investigators of the existence of lists of people to be eliminated.

Witnesses named 12 senior members of the security forces – who report directly to top officials in the government – responsible for disappearances. Some of the people who said they had been tortured reported being held in secret jails, including at the homes of the president and a government minister.

The government denied the existence of such death lists and said the accusations came from “those who want to sow division and the panic within the defence and security corps”.

“It is deplorable that the experts believed such gratuitous and diversionist assertions,” it said.

Sexual violence

According to the UNIIB report, the bodies of some people who were summarily executed were transported across the Ruzizi river and buried in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

It listed 17 types of torture used by the security forces, ranging from attaching weights to the testicles, to forcing a victim to sit on broken glass, or to stay next to the dead body of a relative.

Many women fleeing the country were subjected to sexual violence by the members of the youth wing of the ruling party, Imbonerakure, border guards and unidentified men, the report said. Women opposed to the president’s third term were also subjected to extreme sexual violence, it added.

More than 250,000 people fled to neighbouring countries following the violence, according to figures by the UN’s refugee agency.

Satellite imagery suggested the existence of mass graves, but the government did not respond to an offer to investigate the sites, the report said.

Burundi has set up three commissions of inquiry to look into human rights allegations, but the report accused the government of “blatantly failing” to investigate.

“A cartoon can say a truth that we cannot publish in words” – how cartoonists are challenging Burundi’s media clampdown.

Bujumbura, Burundi – Scrolling through a folder of his work, Burundian cartoonist Alif pauses at a caricature of a journalist in the crosshairs of a rifle scope – an image that seems to sum up the dangers faced by those who continue to report on Burundi’s ongoing political crisis.

“A cartoon like this can say a truth that we cannot publish in words,” Alif explained. For the past five years, he has been working at the weekly Iwacu newspaper in the country’s capital, Bujumbura. His satirical cartoons and caricatures, along with those of his colleague Axel, are splashed across the pages of what is now the sole remaining voice of independent media in Burundi.

For safety reasons, both men use pen names.

“For me, the work we do is very important. But sometimes we are afraid because we know that what happened at Charlie Hebdo can happen here,” said Axel, referring to the January 2015 attack on the French satirical newspaper that left a dozen people dead.

While Iwacu, with its circulation of 3,000 copies, seems unlikely to be targeted by an international group, Axel’s concerns are not entirely unjustified.

Burundi’s once-thriving independent media was systematically gutted after President Pierre Nkurunziza announced his bid for a third term in office in April 2015, and, furthermore, after a failed coup attempt against his government the following May. In the wake of the putsch, independent media outlets and those seen as sympathetic to the opposition were attacked or shuttered.

In October of last year, Christophe Nkezabahizi, a cameraman with the state-run Radio Television Nationale du Burundi, was killed along with his family. A police spokesperson said they were caught in the crossfire while other reports claimed they had been targeted by security forces.

Esdras Ndikumana, the Burundi correspondent for Radio France Internationale and AFP, said he was beaten by members of the National Intelligence Service on August 2, 2015, after taking photos at the scene of the murder of the former intelligence services head, Adolphe Nshimirimana. Other journalists have been arrested and at least 100 have fled the country, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.

The deputy presidential spokesperson Jean-Claude Karerwa said that Nkezabahizi’s death was not necessarily linked to his work as a journalist.

“In my opinion, it was an unfortunate, accidental death,” he said. “Nobody was targeting that journalist … it is simply a regrettable accident.”

Meanwhile, he said the government had “initiated inquiries to find those who are guilty” of the attack on Ndikumana, adding: “As a responsible government, we cannot tolerate this kind of behaviour in Burundi.”

Karerwa said the government encourages media and civil society to “work freely but in full compliance of the rules and regulations of the Republic of Burundi”.

“We want them to work, we know how helpful they are, but they should really help the people of Burundi to unite them, not divide them,” he said.

‘Passing on a message’

Iwacu’s editor-in-chief, Leandre Sikuyavuga, says there is a fine line between what can and cannot be published in the country’s current political climate.

“As the chief, I’m here to oversee all the journalists in order to ensure that we don’t publish something that will cause us problems,” Sikuyavuga explained, adding that the benefit of cartoons is that they are open to “interpretation”.

“People interpret cartoons differently. Someone may say: ‘This person in this cartoon is the president,’ and I can say, ‘But no, it isn’t,'” Sikuyavuga said.

“The cartoons are not about making the government angry. They are about passing on a message,” Alif explained. “Many Burundian people did not go to school, so they cannot read. But even uneducated people can understand caricatures.”

A country in turmoil

Burundi’s population is mostly made up of ethnic Hutus and Tutsis. The country’s civil war, which lasted from 1993 to 2005, saw brutal fighting between the army, led by ethnic minority Tutsis, and ethnic Hutu rebel groups.

Nkurunziza, a former Hutu rebel leader, has served as president since 2005. Last April, his announcement that he would seek a third presidential term plunged the country into political crisis and sparked opposition protests.

Following the failed coup attempt, Nkurunziza was re-elected in a July election that observers say was neither free nor fair.

On November 23, 2015, the government suspended the operations of 10 civil society groups and froze their bank accounts.

On January 15, a former Burundi defence minister and three other generals were sentenced to life in prison for their alleged roles the failed May coup. Nine other alleged conspirators were handed 30-year jail sentences, and eight others were given five-year terms, state radio reported.

Senior opposition politicians, civil society leaders and about 240,000 refugees have all fled the country.

Bodies in the streets

Meanwhile, young men suspected of participating in protests against the president’s bid for a third term and those suspected of even tenuous connections to the rebellion have been rounded up, jailed and even killed.

“The increasing number of enforced disappearances, coupled with allegations of secret detention facilities and mass graves, is extremely alarming,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein in a January 15 statement.

The government has “lashed out against anyone suspected of being an opponent”, said Carina Tertsakian, a senior researcher on Burundi and Rwanda at Human Rights Watch.

“Many have been killed by the security forces, for example, during police searches allegedly to look for weapons,” added Tertsakian. “Young men form the majority of the victims because the police suspect them of being part of the armed opposition.”

The UN has documented more than 400 deaths related to the political crisis, but said that the toll could be much higher.

The police and army in Bujumbura conduct almost daily searches through opposition and Tutsi-majority neighbourhoods, including Musaga, Jabe, Cibatoke, Nyakabiga and Mutakura.

On a recent operation in Cibatoke, police broke windows and kicked down doors as they searched houses for young men.

“Police came with a blacklist,” said a woman whose two sons had not been at home at the time of the search. “They said, ‘Tell your sons if we come back and we find them here, we will kill them.'”

“They check your ID, and if the name matches one on the blacklist, that’s it,” said another resident.

The frequent sight of bodies on the streets inspired one of Axel’s recent cartoons.

In it, children can be seen standing around the bloodied corpse of a man whose hands are tied behind his back. Some of the children cry while others laugh and point.

“We find people dead in the streets all the time with their hands tied behind their backs. When our children are seeing these things, I want to ask: ‘What is their future going to be like?'” Axel said.

Rumours that could ‘mobilise a million’

At the close of a UN Security Council trip to Burundi in January, the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, said she had “personally raised concerns that independent media had been shut down” in Burundi.

“[An] independent media helps everyone because, then, people are not relying on rumour and falsehood and conspiracy theory, but they are hearing from independent sources,” Power said. “To shut down independent voices – it may be tempting, it may be something you think will be stabilising – but in the end, it will only have a destabilising effect.”

The Security Council and African Union (AU) are pushing Burundi to come to the negotiating table and accept an AU peacekeeping force, but Nkurunziza continues to balk at the notion and says that, without consent, such a force would amount to an “invasion”.

After failing to follow through on a threat to send 5,000 AU peacekeepers to Burundi with or without that consent, the AU earlier this month appointed a delegation of five African presidents to try and convince Nkurunziza to accept an African peacekeeping mission.

This comes on the heels of accusations that Rwanda is recruiting and training Burundian refugees as rebels, which Kigali denies.

If a solution is not found soon, Burundi’s political crisis could spill over into other countries in the region, a Burundian expert on security issues and political science said recently in Bujumbura.

“The conflict could become a regional one … due to the emergence of rebel groups,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

At the moment, he said, the issue remains political but cautioned that “some political actors” in Burundi’s government were employing dangerous rhetoric and rumours to stoke ethnic tensions.

“They could use that discourse to mobilise a million people,” he said.

Back at Iwacu, Alif says that the spread of rumours on social media has indeed become a “significant problem” since the government closed down most of the country’s independent media.

“If Burundian people have to rely only on social media for their information, it could lead to civil war,” he reflected.

National Freedom Council’s Agathon Rwasa files case in constitutional court, claiming evidence of fraud in May 20 polls.

Burundi’s main opposition party has filed a case in the country’s constitutional court challenging last week’s presidential election result, claiming there is evidence of fraud.

Burundi’s election commission said on Monday the governing party candidate, retired General Evariste Ndayishimiye, had won the presidential election with 69 percent of the vote. It added that candidate Agathon Rwasa got 24 percent of the vote and the election was peaceful.

But Rwasa, the opposition leader of the National Freedom Council (CNL), while speaking to reporters on Thursday after filing the complaint, said “appalling errors were made across the country,” adding that “no district or province was spared”.

“We have provided evidence that there has been a massive fraud,” Rwasa said. “The announced results are false.”

The court will have until June 5 to decide the case.

Rwasa said if the court did not rule in the CNL’s favour, the party would take the case to the East African Court of Justice in Arusha, Tanzania.

If the legal challenge is not successful, Ndayishimiye will be inaugurated in August for a seven-year term.

Reports of political violence

The May 20 vote to replace President Pierre Nkurunziza had been preceded by reports political violence including the arrest, torture and murder of opposition activists, according to a local rights group and Amnesty International.

There was also controversy over holding the election during the coronavirus pandemic, which critics argued posed a public health risk.

There were also no foreign observers present, as the government said they would have to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival in the country.

The country’s last election in 2015 was marked by violence, with hundreds of Burundians killed and hundreds of thousands exiled during the unrest, in which the opposition accused Nkurunziza of violating a peace deal by running for a third term.

Rwasa said the evidence in his filing showed that people had voted using dead voters’ identities, that polling stations had used an electoral register that has never been published by the electoral body, and that ballot boxes had been stuffed.

While the East African Community, a regional body, gave the election a clean bill of health on Tuesday, the Conference of Bishops of Burundi criticised the conduct during the polling, saying observers from some parties had been chased from polling stations.

A joint statement issued by western diplomats on Wednesday made no reference to any irregularities and urged the opposition to pursue legal paths to contest the election outcome.

The electoral body’s officials were not immediately reachable to comment on Rwasa’s complaints.

Five other candidates also stood in the polls, in which 5.11 million registered voters were eligible to participate.

Court says Ndayishimiye to assume power despite constitution providing for speaker to over in event of a leader’s death.

Burundi’s Constitutional Court has agreed that president-elect Evariste Ndayishimiye should be sworn in immediately after the sudden death of the incumbent, Pierre Nkurunziza.

The constitution provides for the speaker of Parliament to take over in such a situation. The court ruled, however, that “the interim period is not necessary and that … Ndayishimiye must be sworn in as soon as possible”, the government said in a statement posted on Twitter on Friday.

The statement did not say when the swearing-in would be conducted.

There had been uncertainty as to who was in charge in Bujumbura since the government announced Nkurunziza’s death on Tuesday.

Observers were worried about possible discord over the succession among the ranks of Burundi’s powerful group of generals that might have sparked unrest.

Ndayishimiye was declared the winner of the country’s May 20 vote after fending off a challenge from the opposition’s Agathon Rwasa, and was officially due to be sworn in in August.

Nkurunziza leaves behind a deeply isolated country in political and economic turmoil after his divisive 15-year rule.

His controversial decision in 2015 to seek a third term in office prompted protests and a failed coup, with violence causing at least 1,200 deaths, some 400,000 fleeing the country amid a climate of fear marked by a crackdown on the opposition and media.

The United Nations human rights investigators have said the period since 2015 has been marked by likely crimes against humanity committed by state forces, citing extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, disappearances, torture and sexual violence. The government denied the allegations.

Nkurunziza’s decision not to run in the May 20 election shocked many, as it came after the constitution was changed to allow him to do so.

His successor, Ndayishimiye, 52, was handpicked by the governing party’s core group of powerful generals, and won the election with 68.7 percent votes. Opposition claims of widespread fraud were dismissed by the Constitutional Court.

Nkurunziza, named last year “supreme guide for patriotism”, was expected to continue to have a significant say in the country’s politics.

“In principle, it is an opportunity for him [Ndayishimiye] to free himself, in the sense that we would have expected Nkurunziza to play an important role in the future,” said Richard Moncrieff, an expert with the International Crisis Group (ICG).

However, some observers have said he may run into trouble with the generals if he tries to introduce reforms or improve the human rights situation in the country.

Panel of judges rules that poll fraud complaints by opposition leader Agathon Rwasa are ‘null and void’.

Burundi’s constitutional court has rejected an opposition challenge seeking to overturn the results of the country’s presidential election, declaring the governing party’s candidate Evariste Ndayishimiye the winner.

The panel of judges on Thursday ruled that poll fraud complaints by main opposition leader Agathon Rwasa were “null and void”, validating Ndayishimiye’s victory with 68 percent of the May 20 vote, as pronounced by the election commission.

Rwasa’s share of the vote diminished further in the final results to 22.42 percent. Provisional results had given him 24 percent.

The constitutional court – which the opposition has accused of following the governing CNDD-FDD party’s orders – said Rwasa’s National Freedom Council (CNL) failed to provide sufficient proof of its claims.

There was no immediate comment by the CNL, but Rwasa had earlier told The Associated Press news agency he would take the matter to the East African Court of Justice based in neighbouring Tanzania if he is not satisfied with the court’s decision.

Ndayishimiye, 52, a former army general who was handpicked by senior CNDD-FDD figures to succeed longtime President Pierre Nkurunziza, will be sworn in in August for a seven-year mandate.

Nkurunziza will step aside after 15 years. His controversial bid for a third term in 2015 plunged the country into political and economic chaos.

After a failed military coup and a crackdown by security forces, hundreds of thousands of people fled to neighbouring countries to escape the violence.

Human rights groups have alleged widespread abuses by security forces since the previous poll five years ago.

Following a tense campaign marred by inflammatory rhetoric and sporadic violence, Rwasa’s National Freedom Council had dismissed the vote as an “electoral farce”, citing intimidation of voters, the arrest of opposition polling agents, ballot stuffing and proxy voting.
