      "content": "Mozambique has been rocked by the murder of two prominent opposition figures, ratcheting up tensions ahead of planned protests against the election results.\n\nNew opposition party Podemos’ lawyer , Elvino Dias, who was also advisor to its presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane, died alongside party official Paulo Guambe.\n\nThey were gunned down late on Friday night by attackers chasing the car they were travelling in.\n\nVideos posted on social media show a BMW SUV in the middle of the road with many bullet holes in the bodywork.\n\nTheir deaths come as country waits for the results of the contested 9 October election.\n\nThey are due on the 24 October, with provisional results showing a probable win for Frelimo, which has governed Mozambique since its independence from Portugal in 1975.\n\nWestern election observers have however cast doubts on the integrity of the poll, saying it did not meet international standards.\n\nThey have reported issues including vote-buying and the clamping down on dissent against the ruling party.\n\nOpposition parties have also cried fraud, and Podemos has called for a nationwide strike on Monday.\n\nThere are fears now that the protests could turn bloody with Mozambique’s security forces having opened fire on protesters in the past.\n\nThe European Union and Portugal have condemned the killing of the Podemos officials and called for an investigation.",

      "content": "Social media access in Mozambique has been restricted for the second time in a week, according to the global internet watchdog NetBlocks, following calls for nationwide strikes by opposition leaders over a contentious presidential election.\n\nTensions have escalated in Mozambique after the ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power for 49 years, won the October 9 election—a result that opposition parties and election observers claim was flawed.\n\nNetBlocks, a London-based organization monitoring internet disruptions, confirmed that social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, were restricted. This comes after an earlier internet blackout last Friday, the day after election results were announced and following a violent crackdown on protests.\n\nInternet Disruptions and Election Results\n\nNetBlocks described last Friday’s blackout as a \"near-total disruption to mobile internet connectivity,\" affecting many Mozambicans’ ability to access information.\n\nDaniel Chapo of Frelimo was declared the winner of the presidential election on October 24, with nearly 71% of the vote. Venancio Mondlane, leader of the Podemos party, took second place with 20%.\n\nThe announcement of the election results sparked protests, with opposition supporters taking to the streets. Human Rights Watch reported that at least 11 people were killed and more than 50 were injured in clashes with security forces. Police have stated that 20 people were injured and two people died but provided no further details.\n\nOngoing Protests and Strike Calls\n\nMondlane, a former radio host and prominent opposition figure, has used social media to rally supporters. Despite social media restrictions, he has called for a nationwide strike from October 31 to November 7 to protest what he says are unjust election results. By Thursday, Mozambique’s capital, Maputo, appeared empty, with many residents seemingly observing the strike.\n\nPolice warned residents via text messages not to participate in what they called \"acts of sabotage.\" In a statement, the public prosecutor acknowledged that the right to protest is fundamental but warned that anyone causing \"material or personal damage\" would face consequences.\n\nAllegations of Electoral Flaws and Call for Recount\n\nThe Podemos party, which gained surprising traction in the election, has vowed to fight for electoral transparency. Party President Albino Forquilha urged peaceful demonstrations but emphasized the need for justice. Election observers, including representatives from the European Union, have raised concerns over irregularities surrounding the election process.\n\nMondlane’s Podemos party has appealed to Mozambique's Constitutional Court, requesting a recount. The court has since asked the electoral commission for detailed election data from six provinces and Maputo, giving officials eight days to produce the necessary documents.\n\nWith political tension mounting and social media access limited, the situation in Mozambique remains volatile as opposition leaders continue to push for transparency and justice.",

Opposition groups and observers claimed the election was marred by fraud.\n\nIn response to the protests, police used teargas and live ammunition, with Interior Minister Pascoal Ronda stating that security forces acted to restore order amid violent protests. Between Oct. 18 and 26, 73 shooting incidents were recorded, resulting in 10 deaths, according to a statement from the Medical Association of Mozambique and the Order of Doctors of Mozambique. Human Rights Watch, independently confirming 11 deaths and more than 50 serious injuries, noted that actual numbers might be higher since many injured did not report to hospitals.\n\nTensions remain high, especially after an opposition lawyer and official were killed just days after the vote. Opposition candidate Venancio Mondlane, who came in second but claims victory, has called for renewed protests starting Thursday. Residents in Maputo, anticipating more unrest, were seen stocking up on essentials on Wednesday.",

      "content": "European Union election observers have flagged irregularities in Mozambique's election as the country awaits the announcement of official results this week amid protests by opposition supporters and the recent killing of two prominent opposition figures.\n\nThe EU observer mission said Tuesday that some of its 179 election observers deployed to the country had been prevented from observing tabulation processes in some districts, provinces and at the national level.\n\nThe mission also noted “unjustified alteration” of election results at some polling stations.\n\n\"The EU EOM (election observer mission) has continued to observe the electoral process, although EU observers were prevented from observing tabulation processes in some districts and provinces, as well as at the national level.\n\n“To date, the EU EOM has noted irregularities during counting and unjustified alteration of election results at polling station and district level,” chief observer Laura Ballarín said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nBallarin called on electoral bodies in the country to conduct the tabulation process transparently to ensure the credibility of the election results.\n\n“The publication of disaggregated results by polling stations is not only a matter of good practice, but also a strong safeguard for the integrity of results,\" Ballarin said.\n\nTensions around the country's election escalated after the killing of two prominent opposition figures last Friday, followed by protests by opposition supporters on Monday, which were quelled by police firing tear gas at protesters.\n\nElvino Dias, a lawyer and adviser to opposition presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane, was killed when gunmen riddled his car with bullets in the capital, Maputo.\n\nPaulo Guambe, the spokesperson for the PODEMOS opposition party that is backing Mondlane, was also in the car and was killed.\n\nMondlane this week called for nationwide protests, alleging that the governing Frelimo party was rigging the election and his supporters faced off with security forces, raising concerns about further election violence once official results have been released.\n\nThe U.S State Department on Monday condemned the killing of both men and called for a thorough investigation, while urging those aggrieved by election results to file their complaints through official channels.\n\n\"We urge all state institutions, political leaders, citizens and stakeholders to resolve electoral disputes peacefully and lawfully, rejecting violence and inflammatory rhetoric.\n\n“We also call on all Mozambicans to turn to peaceful means of filing electoral grievances and reject violence and violent rhetoric,” it said.\n\nThe election results are expected to be announced this week before being validated by the country's Constitutional Council, which will validate them after handling all the disputes raised by political parties.\n\nThe governing Frelimo party's candidate, Daniel Chapo, is expected to succeed President Filipe Nyusi as the party leads the polls and is expected to extend its 49-year rule.",

      "content": "Mozambique's President-elect struck a conciliatory tone Thursday (Oct. 24) as he spoke shortly after the results of disputed polls were announced.\n\nDaniel Chapo dominated 3 opponents to secure 70.67% of the vote.\n\n\"I want to be the president for all Mozambicans, united from Rovuma to Maputo. Let us engage in dialogue, in conversation. It is not through street protests that Mozambique develops, but through peace, dialogue, harmony, security, and conversation. We are open to any Mozambican who has an idea to contribute to our country.\"\n\nThe ruling party Frelimo will also enjoy absolute majority in Parliament after winning the concurrent polls.\n\nThe electoral cycle has been marred by violence notably against officials of the Podemos coalition.\n\nREAD ALSO: Mozambique rocked by killing of two prominent opposition figures\n\n\"As the Frelimo party, we want to once again reiterate our repudiation of the murders of Elvino Dias and Paulo Guambe as well as other citizens physically affected in this ongoing process of demonstrations.\"\n\nDias, a lawyer and advisor to opposition presidential candidate Mondlane, was killed when gunmen riddled his car with bullets in the port capital of Maputoon October 18. Guambe, the party spokesperson, was also in the car and was killed.\n\nThe president-elect criticized the strikes called by the opposition to protest what it claimed was systematic deceit.\n\nPolice quelled the demonstrations this week, dispersing them by firing teargas.\n\nLutero Simango of the opposition Mozambique Democratic Movement, who got just over 3% of the vote, on Thursday disputed the election outcome and said his party would challenge the results in court.\n\nDespite the confirmation of the results by the election commission, the Constitutional Council will have the final say after it considers any appeals.\n\nMyriad of challenges\n\nThe results of the Oct. 9 election mean the governing Front for the Liberation of Mozambique party, or Frelimo, has extended its 49 years in power since the southern African country gained independence from Portugal in 1975. It then fought a bloody 15-year civil war against rebel group Renamo, which later became the main opposition party and also contested this election.\n\nChapo will face immediate challenges including a terror group affiliated to the Islamic State group that has launched attacks on communities in the hydrocarbon-rich province of Cabo Delgado since 2017. It has carried out several beheadings.\n\nAround 600,000 of the 1.3 million people who fled the province since 2017 have since returned home, many to shattered communities where houses, markets, churches, schools and health facilities have been destroyed, the United Nations said earlier this year.\n\nMozambique also faces high levels of unemployment and hunger, exacerbated by El Nino-induced severe drought. According to the U.N. World Food Program, 1.3 million people face severe food shortages.\n\nFrelimo has often been accused of rigging elections, which it has consistently denied. Current President Filipe Nyusi of Frelimo is stepping down after serving the maximum two terms allowed.\n\nThe EU’s observer mission said this week that some of its election observers had been prevented from monitoring counting in some areas and there was an “unjustified alteration” of results at some polling stations.",

      "content": "Months of drought in southern Africa triggered by the El Niño weather phenomenon have had a devastating impact on more than 27 million people and caused the region's worst hunger crisis in decades, the United Nations' food agency said Tuesday.\n\nThe World Food Program warned it could become a “full-scale human catastrophe.”\n\nFive countries Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe — have declared national disasters over the drought and resultant hunger. The WFP estimates that about 21 million children in southern Africa are now malnourished as crops have failed.\n\nTens of millions in the region rely on small-scale agriculture that is irrigated by rain for their food and to make money to buy provisions. Aid agencies warned of a potential disaster late last year as the naturally occurring El Niño led to below-average rainfall across the region, while its impact has been exacerbated by warming temperatures linked to climate change.\n\n“This is the worst food crisis in decades,” WFP spokesperson Tomson Phiri said. “October in southern Africa marks the start of the lean season, and each month is expected to be worse than the previous one until harvests next year in March and April. Crops have failed, livestock have perished and children are lucky to receive one meal per day.”\n\nThe five countries that declared drought-related disasters have pleaded for international aid, while Angola on the west coast of Africa and Mozambique on the east coast are also “severely affected,” Phiri said, showing the extent to which the drought has swept across the region.\n\n“The situation is dire,” Phiri said. He said the WFP needs around $369 million to provide immediate help but has only received a fifth of that amid a shortfall in donations. The WFP has begun helping with food assistance and other critical support at the request of various governments in the region, he said.\n\nPhiri said southern Africa's crisis came at a time of “soaring global needs,” with humanitarian aid also desperately required in Gaza, Sudan and elsewhere.\n\nOther aid agencies have said the drought in southern Africa is especially harsh, with the United States aid agency, USAID, saying in June it was the most severe drought in 100 years during the January to March agricultural season, wiping out swathes of crops and food for millions.\n\nEl Niño, a weather phenomenon which warms parts of the central Pacific, has different impacts on weather in different parts of the world. The latest El Niño formed in the middle of last year and ended in June. It was blamed, along with human-caused climate change and overall ocean warmth, for a wild 12 months of heat waves and extreme weather.\n\nIn southern Africa, food prices have risen sharply in many areas affected by the drought, increasing the hardship. The drought has also had other damaging effects.\n\nZambia has lost much of its electricity and has been plunged into hours and sometimes days of blackouts because it relies heavily on hydroelectric power from the huge Kariba Dam. The water level of the dam is so low that it can hardly generate any power. Zimbabwe shares the dam and is also experiencing power outages.\n\nAuthorities in Namibia and Zimbabwe have resorted to killing wildlife, including elephants, to provide meat for hungry people.\n\nScientists say sub-Saharan Africa is one of the most vulnerable parts of the world to climate change because of a high dependency on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources. Millions of African livelihoods depend on the climate, while poor countries are unable to finance climate-resilience measures.",

      "content": "Thousands protested in Mozambique's capital on Thursday and security forces responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets, as weeks of post-election unrest continued in the southern African country.\n\nThe protests were sparked by a vote last month that will keep the ruling party in power for more than a half-century amid allegations of rigging.\n\nOpposition parties and many citizens have rejected the results of the Oct. 9 presidential election as fraudulent and growing protests in the capital, Maputo, and other cities have been met by deadly force from police. Thursday's protest was the biggest yet.\n\nInternational rights groups say police have killed at least 20 people since the unrest began nearly a month ago, while local groups say the death toll is more than 50. Authorities are threatening to deploy the army as protesters set fires on the streets and burn ruling party offices.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, the internet is being restricted and social media sites have been blocked. Neighboring South Africa has shut its border post with Mozambique and heightened security around it.\n\nWhat happened in the election?\n\nThe candidate for the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, Daniel Chapo, was declared the winner of the presidential election on Oct. 24. That keeps the party that has governed Mozambique since independence from Portugal in 1975 in power for another five years.\n\nEven before the results were announced, opposition parties claimed fraud, accusing the ruling party, Frelimo, of ballot stuffing, manipulating voter lists, and staffing polling stations with officials loyal to it. Frelimo has long been accused of rigging elections in the country of around 34 million.\n\nThe European Union's observer team said there were irregularities in the election, including the altering of some results. Mozambican media has reported that the Constitutional Council, the supreme body for election law, has asked the commission that ran the election to explain discrepancies.\n\nSenior opposition figures killed\n\nIndependent candidate Venancio Mondlane, who was second behind Chapo in the official results, has led criticism of the vote. He called for a national strike and for people to stay at home in the days after the election in protest at the alleged tampering. But the mood changed when two senior opposition figures were killed in their car in a late-night shooting by unidentified gunmen on Oct. 18.\n\nThe men who were killed were the lawyer for Mondlane and the official spokesperson for the political party that supported Mondlane in the election. Mondlane said they were assassinated and he and opposition supporters gathered near the site of the killings the day after to protest. Police fired tear gas canisters at Mondlane, his aides and journalists who were interviewing him, forcing them to flee.\n\nGrowing protests\n\nSince then, there have been waves of protests across the country. In one city, protesters toppled and cut the head off a statue of current President Filipe Nyusi, who is stepping down after serving a maximum two terms.\n\nMondlane said on social media that he had gone into exile in fear for his life after the killing of his lawyer. His whereabouts are unknown, but he has called on social media for more protests “so that we can then be freed from these shackles that have held us up for 50 years.”\n\nAuthorities have said little other than the protests have been violent and needed to be quelled. They have not given information on the number of people killed or injured in the protests.\n\nRights groups accused the police of shooting at peaceful protests in the days after the election and said children were among the victims. Anger among opposition supporters has swelled. The presidential palace is under heavy guard.\n\nA history of civil war and violence\n\nMozambique is still in the shadow of a bloody 15-year civil war the leftist Frelimo fought against rebel group Renamo after independence. The country only held its first elections in 1994 and this was the first vote where there were no armed groups connected to political parties after a process to disarm militias.\n\nThe country, which has rich natural resources including large, newly discovered natural gas fields, was already struggling with a yearslong insurgency by an Islamic State-affiliated group in the northern province of Cabo Delgado.\n\nMondlane, who broke away from Renamo, has support among Mozambique's disaffected youth and he and the new Podesa party that is backing him have become the biggest challenge to Frelimo's long rule.",

      ],
      "content": "Maputo, Mozambique — In a state of the nation address late Tuesday, outgoing Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi invited the four presidential candidates for a dialogue as part of a bid to end post-election unrest that has left several people dead and dozens of others injured.\n\nProtesters say the October 9 election won by ruling party candidate Daniel Chapo was rigged. The government denies that accusation.\n\nNyusi said the demonstrations are having a negative impact on the economy, as they limit the activities of companies and ports and increase unemployment, among other issues.\n\nHe said in his address that he will work to pacify Mozambique until the last day of his term, but he needs all Mozambicans to come together to solve the problems. He also hoped that, by meeting with the four candidates from the recent election, they could find a solution that benefits the country.\n\nAt least 30 people are reported to have died during the post-election violence that flared after electoral officials said Chapo, of the ruling Frelimo party, won the presidential election with more than 60% of the vote.\n\nVenancio Mondlane, the independent candidate who came in second with 20%, challenged the result and called for nationwide protests.\n\nInternational observers say the election was marred by irregularities.\n\nNyusi's invitation to the dialogue comes a few days after the Attorney General's Office filed cases against Venancio Mondlane and his PODEMOS party to compensate the state for property damage caused during protests.\n\nHuman rights activist Adriano Nuvunga said the president is trying to prod Mondlane into dialogue while refusing to acknowledge the protesters' grievances. The president has repeatedly called for protesters to wait until the Constitutional Council validates the election results.\n\nNuvunga expressed skepticism over the dialogue, which he said is carried out with sticks through legal proceedings. He said the president's call for a meeting did not seem genuine, adding Nyusi has been hiding behind the Constitutional Council for a long time, which has discredited the legitimacy of the results.\n\nMondlane holds historical ruling Frelimo figures responsible for issues troubling the country, including widespread poverty and high rates of youth unemployment.\n\nBut Methodist Bishop Dinis Matsolo said dialogue is the best way to calm the country and move forward.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mozambique Governance Legal Affairs By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

      "title": "Mozambique: EU and UK Indirectly Back Frelimo",
      "author": "Unknown Author",
      "content": "Plainclothes hit squads to kill demonstrators were ordered to be established last week by the General Commander of the Police, Bernardino Rafael, in a video conference he held with provincial commanders. They then shared the order with the district commanders. The instruction is to carry out selective shootings so as not to create a great impact, as happened last week in Namicopo, in Nampula city, when the local police murdered seven demonstrators and wounded more than a dozen. Amateur videos and photos provide evidence. These two photos show two white pick-ups with plainclothes police.\n\nTwo key donors - the EU and the UK - have indirectly backed Frelimo in the dispute over the elections, in a way which will clearly strengthen the position of hard-liners within the Frelimo leadership. Yesterday, 18 November, the European Council of Ministers approved another €20mn ($21mn) to support Rwandan troops in Mozambique, in direct support of Frelimo policy on the Cabo Delgado war. And yesterday was leaked a 13 November letter from Chatham House in London to Daniel Chapo \"to congratulate you on your presidential victory in the October elections and … looking forward to the validation of the results by the Constitutional Council\" and inviting him to speak at Chatham House. Letter: https://bit.ly/Moz-CH-Chapo\n\nThere were three largely corrupt elections at about the same time, in Venezuela, Georgia, and Mozambique. On the first two, Europe moved quickly to condemn the elections and say that the re-elections of presidents was not credible. In Mozambique, even in the face of the opposition-called general strike, the diplomatic mood has been to wait for the Constitutional Council (CC) to rule and then to support negotiations under a Frelimo government given legitimacy by the CC. In last year's municipal elections, there was firm evidence seen by this bulletin that Venancio Mondlane and Renamo won in both Maputo and Matola, but the CC gave the victory to Frelimo and no donor government opened its mouth to complain.\n\nBoth UK and EU actions were taken in Europe and reflect timing of processes there. There is annoyance in Maputo that they reflect agendas in capitals and that advice was not taken from Maputo about a fast-moving process.\n\nBoth the EU and UK actions are indirect actions, by bodies that are slightly distanced from the crisis within Mozambique. Chatham House is the 100-year-old “Royal Institute of International Affairs” and is “independent” but close to the British foreign office and diplomatic community. The Chatham House letter reflects an assumption that Chapo will be President and it is best to delay until after that is confirmed by the CC.\n\nThe European Council of Ministers is an EU body, but it is composed of national ministers. Thus its decision means a broad agreement to fund Rwandan mercenaries in Cabo Delgado. The EU Council is supporting the Frelimo line that the Cabo Delgado war is a foreign invasion with no local roots. Many people who have studied the Cabo Delgado war say it is mainly disaffected youth who see no jobs or future, and who see Frelimo with foreigners stealing the resource wealth. €20mn could easily create 10,000 jobs and would virtually stop the war if the 4000 insurgents were given those jobs.\n\nWhat is the difference between Venezuela, Georgia and Mozambique? In Venezuela, the oil is nationalised. In Georgia the government is pro-Russian. But Mozambique has a docile government that allows foreign companies to control the gas and other resources. There were no donor complaints about the blatant theft of elections in Maputo and Matola last year. Even through there was ample proof, no one said Venancio Mondlane was the legitimate mayor of Maputo.\n\nThis year many observers groups have reported widespread fraud, but the donors say \"wait for the CC\" which rubber-stamped Mondlane's fraudulent defeat last year. The international community may again be backing Frelimo, but young people are clearly not. And the donors and lenders will play a key role in the next few months. Will they back the ruling party and take their gas and minerals, or will they support young people who see no future and have had enough?\n\n---------------\n\nMondlane stops big demonstrations\n\nSpeaking on Facebook this morning, Venancio Mondlane said there would be no big marches this week. Instead there will be three days of mourning - Wednesday-Friday - 20-22 November - for the victims of killing and kidnapping.\n\nHe called for only one disruptive action. At noon on all three days all cars should stop wherever they are for 15 minutes. Then drive off but continue hooting your horn until 13h.\n\nPeople without cars should make posters with messages against kidnaps and killings and for restoring fair elections and a free Mozambique\n\nPanelaços continue every night 21h to 22h, but only inside houses or blocks of flats or groups of houses. No marches.\n\nDuring the three days of mourning people should wear black clothing, ribbons , gloves or other symbols of protest and solidarity.\n\nMondlane also opposed the violence and vandalism of some people, who he said were hired to infiltrate the protests give it a bad image.\n\n---------------\n\nNyusi calls candidates for meeting\n\nPresident Filipe Nyusi in a 45 minute national speech this afternoon made only one concrete proposal to resolve the crisis. He said he would organise a meeting of the four presidential candidates: Daniel Chapo, Venancio Mondlane, Ossufo Momade and Lutero Simango. He said the biggest block to resolving the crisis were big egos. He said we should wait for the Constitutional Council to report.\n\nOtherwise there were no concrete proposals and no acceptance of any problems. He called for calm, tolerance and patience. He said the rights of people to move freely were more important than the rights of protestors. And he said there was no right to stop the government from functioning.\n\n---------------\n\nPlain clothes hit squads to shoot demonstrators\n\nPlain clothes hit squads to kill demonstrators were ordered to be established last week by the General Commander of the Police, Bernardino Rafael, in a video conference he held with provincial commanders. They then shared the order with the district commanders. The instruction is to carry out selective shootings so as not to create a great impact, as happened last week in Namicopo, in Nampula city, when the local police murdered seven demonstrators and wounded more than a dozen.\n\nAmateur videos and photos provide evidence. These two photos show two white pick-ups with plain clothes police.\n\nOne video shows a uniformed and a plain clothes policemen opening fire against demonstrators. One gives orders to his colleague to “rub out” one of the demonstrators. “Take down one, chief, rub out just one, take out just one”, he ordered, in the midst of various shots fired by members of the police.\n\nIn several cities, plain clothes police members have used vehicles without number plates to fire against demonstrators and then to flee. One example can be seen in this video, where members of the Rapid Intervention Unit, all armed, take off their uniforms, put on normal clothing and get into a dual cabin Toyota vehicle without registration plates. In some cases, the police follow the demonstrators and shoot them inside their own homes, as happened last week. Five demonstrators were shot in a house. In some places plain clothes police agents park vehicles on the streets used by the demonstrators and identify the main leaders so that they can be shot later.\n\nMonday night (18 November) a plain clothes police agent shot a citizen in the area known as Pilivi, Matola. The individual was killed with a shot to the head.\n\n---------------\n\nOne dead and about a dozen injured in Chimoio\n\nIt all began when members of the police set fire to the stall of Paulino White in the 38 Millimetre Market in Chimoio, Manica. She is a personal friend of Venâncio Mondlane who mobilised people in support of Podemos and Mondlane. Other stallholders rose in revolt against the police. Demonstrators burned tyres and blocked roads. The police went there and the result was that about ten people were injured by police bullets. One of those shot later died.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mozambique Governance External Relations By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

The bullet perforated the flesh and broke the leg.\n\nThree more deaths have been confirmed, including a man believed to be a police agent, who was killed by a crowd in Murrupula, Nampula.\n\n---------------\n\nNo action a month after murders of Elvino Dias and Paulo Guambe\n\nLawyer Elvino Dias and Podemos election agent Paulo Guambe, were murdered in the early morning of 19 October in the Maputo neighbourhood of Malhangalene. The two were murdered in a hail of 25 bullets. It is suspected that the killers are members of a police death squad. The murderers were driving a white vehicle and the death squads use this type of vehicle (as in the pictures above). The first version, presented by the Maputo City police spokesperson was that the two were murdered by rivals after a squabble over a woman. But this version soon collapsed and did not even convince the Minister of the Interior, Pascoal Ronda, who said the causes of the killings were unknown. So far, the police have not presented any clues about the suspects..\n\n---------------\n\nProperty of Frelimo members set on fire\n\nIn Dondo and Nhamatanda, Sofala, various items of property belong to the Frelimo Party and its members were vandalised and set on fire over the weekend. In Mafambisse, Dondo, a group of demonstrators burnt the Pioneer Market and the office of the Frelimo Party. The first act happened early on Saturday morning. In all, 25 stalls were burnt down.\n\nEarly on Monday morning, five Frelimo Party members were threatened with death in their homes in Munhonha and Mussassa neighbourhoods, and a Frelimo Party office was burnt down.\n\nIn Nhamatanda, unknown arsonists, early on Saturday morning, set fire to five houses and a shed where the local headquarters of Frelimo in Machessa neighbourhood, was operating, as shown in the photo.",

At least 50 demonstrators have been killed by police, far more than insurgents killed in Cabo Delgado in the same period. An unprecedented general strike is now in its 3rd week.

      "content": "The many roots of Mozambique’s deadly insurgency\n\nNew field research in Cabo Delgado sheds light on one of Africa’s least understood violent conflicts.\n\nPublished on 08 September 2022 in ISS Today By Liesl Louw-Vaudran\n\n\n\nConflict erupted in Mozambique’s northern Cabo Delgado province just a few years after some of Africa’s biggest gas reserves were discovered in the Rovuma Basin off the coast. Mozambicans see this as no coincidence.\n\nA new study by the Institute for Security Studies and the Judicial Training Institute of Mozambique conducted extensive field research in Cabo Delgado. It shows that citizens blame the discovery and bad governance of resources, notably natural gas and rubies, for the escalation of terrorism in the province. Over 4 000 people have been killed and 800 000 displaced due to the insurgency that broke out at the end of 2017.\n\nCabo Delgado province in Mozambique\n\n\n\n\n\n(click on the map for the full size image) (click on the map for the full size image)\n\nIn a survey of 309 people and 28 key informants, nearly half of the respondents said natural resources escalated the crisis. The announcements of US$60 billion investments in liquid natural gas came with promises of huge wealth and opportunity for the country. But locals feel marginalised by corrupt elites. Some have lost their land and livelihoods to the gas infrastructure built onshore. They are doubtful that these projects will reduce poverty and improve services.\n\nMeanwhile, the discovery of some of the world’s largest ruby deposits in Cabo Delgado attracted fortune seekers and informal miners from across East Africa. They were chased away when multinationals took over the mine, leading to protests in 2019.\n\nAsked to choose between a range of options, 45% of respondents said the main root cause of the insurgency was the discovery of rubies and natural gas. Another 4% mentioned the bad governance of natural resources. Far fewer people thought the availability of illicit arms (13%), economic marginalisation (6%) and elite greed (5%) were the primary causes.\n\nThis confirms that recruitment drives by the militant group Ahlu-Sunnah wal Jama’a (ASWJ), supported by Islamic State in Mozambique, were facilitated by the so-called natural resource curse. It not only increased inequality but raised the stakes in the province. What was initially a small radical group grew to become a major menace that drove away big multinationals like TotalEnergies.\n\nCitizens blame the discovery of natural resources for the escalation of terrorism in Cabo Delgado\n\nBefore the insurgency, Cabo Delgado was already notorious for illicit activities such as trafficking in drugs, timber and people, as well as ruby smuggling. The study however showed no significant links between the terror group and organised crime. So far, there is no indication that ASWJ’s main aim is to get its hands on this lucrative illicit business.\n\nThe strongest evidence linking insurgents to drug smuggling dates back to the 2021 seizure of 250 kg of heroin in a building formerly occupied by ASJW militants. No one was arrested, and no other evidence links the insurgency to the heroin trade, which has long been rife along this coastline.\n\nWhile the study’s respondents anecdotally referred to the insurgents as being involved in arms, drug and human trafficking, they didn’t believe this was the group’s source of income. Only 8% said the insurgents fund their activities from organised crime. A much larger proportion (38%) mentioned foreign sources, and 13% said the group used its own funds.\n\nThis confirms reports that the illicit economy, donations and raids on local sources such as banks are the major sources of financing. In the March 2021 Palma attack, US$1 million was robbed from banks and businesses.\n\nThe study confirms that the illicit economy, donations and raids are the insurgents’ major funding sources\n\nCabo Delgado residents believe regional disparities between privileged elites based in the capital Maputo in Mozambique’s far south, and the marginalised northerners, play a more significant role in driving the conflict than ethnic considerations.\n\nTensions between the mostly Muslim coastal communities of the Mwani and Makua groups, and the Christian Makonde are mentioned as a backdrop to the crisis. However, these communities have lived together peacefully for centuries. Ethnicity was seen by only 2% of respondents as the primary driver of the insurgency.\n\nThe role of an extremist ideology and the recruitment and radicalisation of ASWJ shouldn’t be overlooked. Just over 60% of people said religion plays some role in the violence, although many believed that Islam is being instrumentalised. The group’s messaging and modus operandi when recruiting youths were described by victims and eyewitnesses as resembling those of violent extremists elsewhere in the world.\n\nMozambicans, notably those in the country’s three northernmost provinces where over 60% of people claim to be Muslims, have historically belonged to Sufi orders. However, in the early 2000s, more radical anti-Sufi groups emerged. ASWJ’s emergence is seen as part of a global wave of Islamic revivalism. The teachings of Kenyan cleric Aboud Rogo Mohammed played a particularly significant role in radicalisation in Mozambique.\n\nReconciliation between Muslims and Christians in Cabo Delgado is needed, but also among Muslims\n\nThe Cabo Delgado study found that radicalisation occurs predominantly in mosques and to a lesser extent market places. This is contrary to the global trend where radicalisation increasingly happens online and through other illicit networks.\n\nThere is a need for dialogue and reconciliation between Muslims and Christians in Cabo Delgado, also among Muslims. Other government action needed includes partnering with local organisations to address legitimate grievances, setting up a commission of inquiry into the drivers of violent extremism, and developing a national strategy to deal with all aspects of the crisis.\n\nMilitary interventions alone won’t end the insurgency. However, more effective strategies by Mozambican security forces and the country’s international partners play a key role. Tightening border security and improving intelligence sharing is also vital.\n\nThere should also be greater cooperation between the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Mission in Mozambique (SAMIM) and the Rwandan forces on the ground. Forces should consider scenario six of the SADC counter-terrorism strategy, focusing on peacekeeping, as an exit strategy. And the African Union should regularly discuss the situation and help SAMIM.\n\nThe ASWJ threat in Mozambique has proven to be one of Africa's least understood and most nebulous insurgencies. Little is known about the group’s identity, aims and ideology, and the militants have no clear communication strategy. This makes solving the crisis even harder. However, acknowledging and tackling the root causes of the crisis is essential for long-term peace in Cabo Delgado.\n\nLiesl Louw-Vaudran, Senior Researcher, ISS Pretoria\n\nRegister here to join the seminar today on the research findings.

      "content": "Mozambique security forces killed at least 10 children and injured dozens of others while trying to suppress weeks of protests following a disputed presidential election, Human Rights Watch said Monday.\n\nSecurity forces detained hundreds of other minors, some of them for days in violation of international law, since election results were announced a month ago, the rights group said.\n\nThe southern African country has been beset by unrest after the ruling party's candidate was declared the winner of the Oct. 9 election despite the opposition's claims of fraud and international observers' criticism of the vote, including a team from the European Union.\n\nMozambican authorities have not given out details on how many people have been killed or detained in the protests, but said some of the demonstrations turned violent and had to be quelled by security forces.\n\nDaniel Chapo was announced the election winner on Oct. 24, extending the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique party's unbroken half-century rule since independence from Portugal in 1975. Chapo is set to succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served the maximum two terms.\n\nThe leftist party, known as Frelimo, has often been accused of rigging elections to remain in power. There were violent protests after last year's local elections, but these demonstrations have been the biggest challenge to Frelimo's long rule.\n\nThe protests spilled into the streets in the capital, Maputo, and other major cities after two senior opposition figures were killed by unknown gunmen in a late-night shooting on Oct. 18 that their party called a political assassination.\n\nSince then, thousands have responded to regular calls for protests on social media from independent presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane, who lost to Chapo. Mondlane has left the country over fears for his safety, he said, after his lawyer was one of the two opposition members killed when the car they were in was ambushed and riddled with bullets on a street in Maputo. No arrests have been made in those killings.\n\nInternational rights groups say at least 30 people have been killed by security forces firing live bullets at protesters, while Mozambican groups say the death toll is around 50. The Mozambique Bar Association said earlier this month that it had secured the release of more than 2,700 people who had been detained by security forces, many of them teenagers.\n\nThe protests have forced schools and businesses to close and led many Mozambicans to stay home. The army has been deployed to keep order.",

The protests, fuelled by anger over the disputed October elections, quickly escalated, leading to violent clashes with security forces.\n\nLocal police reported at least five deaths and three serious injuries across Mozambique, including in Maputo, Nampula, and Zambezia. However, local NGO Plataforma Eleitoral Decide claimed that the true death toll is significantly higher, with at least 88 fatalities reported from the demonstrations.\n\nJoão Tembe, one of the protesters, explained the motivations behind the unrest: “The soldiers show strength and say they’re with us. They wear masks because they are afraid of the 'superior order,' but they still support our cause. My protest is not vandalism. I am concerned about the future of young people, what will happen to them tomorrow—that’s what matters to me.”\n\nAnother protester, Luciano Michele, criticised the government’s crackdown: “You take someone to jail just for holding a peaceful demonstration. Why arrest them?”\n\nThe protests are a direct challenge to the election results, with demonstrators demanding justice and fairness in the political process. As tensions rise, concerns grow about the future of Mozambique’s democracy.",

      "title": "Mozambique's Deadly Protests - How the Country Got Here",
      "author": [
        "Luca Bussotti"
      ],
      "content": "analysis\n\nThe protests that followed Mozambique's contested October elections have been the most protracted and deadliest since multiparty democracy in 1990. Police have reportedly killed at least 50 since Daniel Chapo, from the ruling Frelimo, was declared winner by a fanciful 70%. The party has been in power since independence in 1975.\n\nA parallel count by the small party, Optimistic Party for the Development of Mozambique (Podemos), which supported opposition candidate Venâncio Mondlane, claimed he was the rightful winner.\n\nThe government's violent response to the popular protests has been condemned by various international entities. Less so by African regional ones, always very cautious when it comes to condemning a member country.\n\nMozambique finds itself in a situation it was in almost 40 years ago. Then it was forced to undergo a necessary but painful transition from its Marxist-Leninist path. This was precipitated by the collapse of its economy. It, however, remained an undemocratic one-party state. Today, it faces the challenge of changing its entire governance model.\n\nI specialise in African politics, with a particular emphasis on Lusophone African countries, including Mozambique. In my view, the ongoing political crisis in Mozambique is rooted in history.\n\nAt independence from Portugal in 1975, the country became a one-party Marxist-Leninist state.\n\nImmediately after independence, it was plunged in a bloody civil war between the new Frelimo government and Renamo.\n\nIn 1990, the country adopted a new constitution, marking\n\nthe beginning of a democratic climate that led the country to its first multiparty elections (in 1994).\n\nA 1992 peace accord led to the downing of arms. However, rather than building on the new harmony between the political and social parties, Frelimo continued to control all state institutions. Its elites seized key economic assets. Yet another opportunity lost to embark on a democratic path.\n\nSince departing from Marxist-Leninist path, officially in 1989, the party has been following a hybrid governance model. It has in place ineffectual, formally democratic institutions, amid an authoritarian political culture. Simply put, the country's political system falls somewhere between a genuine democracy and an authoritarian regime.\n\nIf Mozambique's Marxist revolution imploded some 40 years ago, undermining the dreams of social justice and progress it had promised at independence, today the funeral must be held for its hybrid model of democracy, that has played on too many ambiguities. The problems signified by the post-election crisis have been smouldering under the ashes for decades.\n\nWhat bedevils Mozambique\n\nFirstly, there has never been a climate of peace and genuine dialogue between Frelimo and Renamo, the protagonists in a long and bloody civil war (1977-1992).\n\nSecondly, the \"miraculous' transition\" from socialism to democracy had never seen popular public involvement with respect to strategic choices for the country. Importantly, a single-party (Frelimo) parliament approved the new democratic and pluralistic constitution (1990).\n\nThirdly, the legitimisation of the new democratic cause did not come so much from the voting citizenry, but from the international community. Specifically from western countries that, a few years earlier, had considered Frelimo the absolute devil. Renamo was the only bulwark against Marxist atheists linked to the Soviet Union, which denied its citizens individual, political and cultural rights.\n\nSuddenly, Frelimo became the party to rely on to drive Mozambique's development (and Western interests). Renamo was to play the role of a political extra, useful only to legitimise elections that are frequently won by Frelimo, without any serious capacity to win itself.\n\nFinally, rampant corruption took root.\n\nThe first multi-party elections were held in 1994 and won by Frelimo. Despite some hiccups, they were widely considered free and fair.\n\nThe first challenge to this status quo came in the second multi-party elections of 1999, which the opposition candidate, Alfonso Dhlakama, is widely considered to have won. However, the Frelimo-controlled electoral commission declared the party's Joaquim Chissano the winner. This, despite the reservations of independent observers.\n\nSlide to authoritarianism\n\nIt was clear that no other political party in Mozambique would be able to govern the country, except Frelimo.\n\nThus, elections in the country went on to play a role of regularly returning Frelimo to power, with unreliable poll results, since the advent of multiparty democracy.\n\nEverything has since played out on the edge of a very precarious balance: elections yes, but controlled, freedom of the press yes, but with few truly independent organs and most under the control, direct or otherwise, of the party-state.\n\nCivil society, essentially financed by Northern European countries, is tolerated. The Frelimo political elite see it as hostile and in the pay of foreign interests. It was often the target of politically motivated attacks; from journalists, academics to activists. Lawyer Elvino Dias and opposition leader Paulo Guambe are the latest victims.\n\nThe 2014 elections, which were held in the midst of the second Frelimo-Renamo war, and elected Filipe Nyusi to power, were similarly stolen.\n\nAfter the 2018 death of Dhlakama, Renamo's long term leader, Renamo elected an uncharismatic general, Ossufo Momade, as its president. He was content to play second fiddle to Frelimo. He even negotiated his own party's election results with Frelimo leader Filipe Nyusi, thus accepting a negotiated democracy.\n\nHowever, some unforeseen variables entered the political game.\n\nFirstly, the new Nyusi presidency showed, right from the start, signs of particular inefficiency. Major public services collapsed, driving citizens to exasperation. Frelimo's electoral base began to show signs of impatience with a government that\n\nbecame increasingly corrupt\n\nfailed to pay civil servants' salaries regularly, triggering continuous strikes. Thus, morale in the army is low as it fights jihadist terrorism in Cabo Delgado under difficult circumstances.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mozambique Governance Legal Affairs By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

The poverty index has increased by 87% in the last 10 years.\n\nLooking forward\n\nAccording to Mozambican law, Nyusi is still the president until his successor begins his mandate on 15 January. In addition, the Supreme Court has not yet deliberated on the official election results.\n\nWhatever happens in the coming months, what is certain is that Mozambique will never be the same.\n\nIf Chapo ultimately assumes the highest office in Mozambique, then authoritarianism will likely be consolidated. This is not so much because of his personal profile. But because he will have to govern against a large part of the population that is discontented.\n\nHe would thus likely resort to repression to contain dissent. Also because Nyusi will continue to wield considerable power behind the scenes as president of the Frelimo.\n\nThere is another possible way out of the crisis. That is to appoint a provisional, transitional government, cancelling the elections and preparing for a rerun in a few months, or a few years. This would entail Nyusi or a select committee playing the role of ferryman. This would be an elegant way to genuine democracy and for better times.\n\nLuca Bussotti, Professor at the Phd Course in Peace, Democracy, Social Movements and Human Development, Universidade Técnica de Moçambique (UDM)",

      "content": "On Monday, Pemba, Mozambique, began a rebuilding and cleanup effort following the devastation caused by Cyclone Chido, which struck the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday.\n\nThe cyclone, classified as a category 4 storm by the French weather service, produced winds exceeding 220 kph (136 mph).\n\nThe Cabo Delgado province, home to approximately 2 million residents, was the first area affected, with numerous homes, schools, and health facilities either partially or completely destroyed.\n\nIn Pemba, shelters accommodated displaced individuals while others started to rebuild their severely damaged properties.\n\nA UNICEF spokesperson highlighted that communities might be isolated from schools and health services for weeks, and local authorities warned of a significant risk of landslides.\n\nCyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean runs from December to March, and southern Africa has recently experienced a series of powerful storms.\n\nIn 2019, Cyclone Idai resulted in over 1,300 fatalities, primarily affecting Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe.\n\nLast year, Cyclone Freddy caused more than 1,000 deaths across various countries in the region.\n\nThese cyclones pose threats of flooding and landslides, and the resulting stagnant water can lead to severe outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as cholera, as well as dengue fever and malaria.\n\nCyclone Chido inflicted widespread damage on Mayotte, a French territory in the Indian Ocean, resulting in numerous fatalities as it headed toward Africa's eastern coastline.\n\nThe Comoros islands, located north of Mayotte, were also under siege from the storm, leading to the issuance of the highest alert in certain regions.\n\nInland Malawi and Zimbabwe were preparing for the cyclone's impact. Malawi's Department of Disaster Management Affairs warned of expected flooding and advised residents in at-risk areas to move to higher ground.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, authorities recommended that some individuals prepare for evacuation. Research indicates that cyclones are becoming more severe due to climate change, yet poorer countries in southern Africa, which contribute very little to this global issue, are facing the brunt of significant humanitarian crises.",

      "content": "Tropical Cyclone Chido ripped through Southern Africa, killing nearly 100 people in Mozambique and damaging thousands of homes and buildings.\n\nMaputo, Mozambique — At least 34 people were killed and 43 injured when Cyclone Chido smashed into three northern provinces of Mozambique on Sunday and Monday. The head of the country's disaster management agency says the numbers are preliminary, as rescue teams search through rubble.\n\nAfter visiting the affected areas late Monday, the chair of Mozambique's National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction, Luisa Meque, said around 2.5 million people were affected by the cyclone.\n\nSeveral districts in Cabo Delgado province, including the capital Pemba, were hit hard by the cyclone, and teams on the ground are reporting significant damage.\n\nThe cyclone made landfall Sunday in Mecufi, a district in the province of Cabo Delgado, and destruction in the area was near total, with 100% of homes damaged and very few structures still standing.\n\nCanjar Amade told VOA via WhatsApp that he lived through the cyclone tearing apart his house. He said the wind took the sheets off during the night, and the house fell down Monday morning.\n\nMeteorologist Acacio Tembe from the national weather agency said the provinces of Niassa and Cabo Delgado, as well as other parts of Mozambique, are still getting hit by remnants of the storm, including rains and strong winds.\n\nThe system, which also hit Malawi and the island of Mayotte, is expected to dissipate near Zimbabwe by late Tuesday.\n\nMozambique is considered one of the countries most severely affected by global climate change. During the rainy season, which runs from October to April, it experiences cyclical floods and tropical cyclones.\n\nExperts say with a potential La Nina effect in southern Africa in early 2025, the frequency and intensity of heavy rains and tropical cyclones is expected to increase in the Indian Ocean, with floods expected in areas currently affected by drought.",

      "content": "Cyclone Chido has wreaked havoc in parts of Mozambique and Malawi. Building more resilience in advance of major storms that will no doubt follow is important, experts say.\n\nCyclone Chido has brought widespread devastation to northern Mozambique. It swept from the east coast of Africa to Mozambique and Malawi after hitting the French Indian Ocean island of Mayotte in the Comoros archipelago on December 15. Thousands of people in the Cabo Delgado and Nampula provinces of Mozambique have been displaced.\n\nIn recent years, major storms — Cyclone Freddy in 2023, Gombe in 2022 and Idai in 2019 — have battered Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Madagascar during southern hemisphere summer.\n\nChido's devastation highlights a broader trend of worsening weather patterns fueled by climate change. Southern Africa is experiencing more and more extreme weather patterns as global temperatures rise.\n\n\"It's all because with global warming, the temperatures on the Indian oceans are increasing more than normal. And that is creating a conducive environment for these cyclones to develop,\" Lucy Mtilatila, Director of Climate Change and Meteorological Services in Malawi, said.\n\n\"Right now, we are seeing that indeed climate change is affecting us. We used to have tropical cyclones affecting Malawi, but it was maybe once in 10 years. But right now, you can see the frequency,\" she told DW.\n\nMayotte hit by worst storm in a century To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nConcerns over long-term impact on affected African nations\n\nCyclone Chido unleashed heavy rains and winds of up to 260 km/h (160 mph), damaging buildings, uprooting trees, and plunging entire neighborhoods into darkness. Two fatalities were reported in the port city of Pemba in Cabo Delgado, and a three-year-old child was reported to have drowned in Nampula.\n\nThe National Institute of Meteorology (INAM) said more than 250 millimeters (10 inches) of rain fell in just 24 hours, worsening conditions in an already vulnerable region. Humanitarian organizations have been quick to respond, but the need is immense.\n\n\"UNICEF is concerned about the immediate impact of this cyclone — the loss of life, the damage to schools, homes, and healthcare facilities,\" said Guy Taylor, a UNICEF representative in Mozambique.\n\n\"But we're also worried about the longer-term impacts: children potentially being cut off from learning for weeks, people unable to access healthcare, and the spread of waterborne diseases like cholera and malaria.\"\n\nEmergency shelters have been set up for some 2,800 people in Pemba. But the true scale of the damage and displacement remained unclear. Officials said contact to some districts, such as Memba in Nampula Province, remained sparse due to power outages.\n\nCyclone Chido destroyed buildings and uprooted trees in the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique on December 16 Image: UNICEF MOZAMBIQUE/via REUTERS\n\nExtent of the damage not yet clear\n\nMalawi and Mozambique are still trying to rebuild the infrastructure lost in the previous cyclones.\n\nLuisa Meque, the head of Mozambique's National Institute for Risk and Disaster Management, estimates that Chido's intensity parallels that of Cyclone Freddy last year. But assessements are still ongoing, she told DW.\n\nIn Malawi, schools were suspended across 15 districts amid the heavy rains and strong winds. The cyclone weakened as it moved inland toward Niassa Province and on to southern Malawi.\n\nMozambican officials said they were concerned about the storm's potential to exacerbate food insecurity and damage infrastructure.\n\n\"I don't have the records on how this has impacted the fields right now, but we know in some areas they haven't planted yet. We are waiting for the assessments,\" Mtilatila said.\n\nA satellite image showing Cyclone Chido over Mayotte to the east of Mozambique and west of Madagascar Image: CIRA/AFP\n\nPreparing long before a cyclone hits is key\n\nMalawi appeared prepared to handle Cyclone Chido.\n\n\"This time around, many institutions were ready. The health, education, and transport sectors, we are preparing,\" Mtilatila told DW.\n\nThe coordination between national and district-level teams was much stronger than it was when Cyclone Freddy struck.\n\n\"We have so many sectors that are coming in to work together to respond to such kinds of disasters,\" Mtilatila said.\n\n\"[In] 2019, we were affected by Idai. In 2022, we were affected by Tropical Storm Ana and Tropical Cyclone Gomi. And then 2023, Tropical Cyclone Freddy. We haven't recovered yet. It's really tough for the communities to be resilient to these disasters right now.”\n\nMtilatila believes that greater emphasis needs to be placed on plans to relocate vulnerable communities, construct resilient infrastructure, and adapt farming practices: \"Preparedness it's not only about when the cyclone is about to hit, but it's how we prepare ourselves when we are planning our settlements, for example. That's where we need to start from.\"\n\nMozambique: The difficult journey to get to Ivagalane school To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nOutlook for the future\n\nThe Malawian government had ordered food and relief supplies in advance of Cyclone Chido. The country, one of the least developed in the world, is facing drought and hunger.\n\n\"Last year was not a good year for us because of El Nino, the harvest yields were not as good. So already people are struggling when it comes to access to food,\" Mtilatila told DW.\n\nMeanwhile, UNICEF, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and ActionAid are among the organizations involved in relief efforts in Mozambique and Malawi. According to Guy Taylor, UNICEF representative, even more assistance is urgently needed.\n\nAnd with climate change increasing the frequency and severity of cyclones, experts are calling for greater international support to build resilience and address the root causes of global warming.\n\n\" As we are being impacted by these cyclones, we are learning a lot. So, as we are building back, we do it better so that we should not make ourselves vulnerable,\" Mtilatila told DW.\n\nEdited by: Benita van Eyssen",

      "content": "Cyclone Chido killed at least 94 people in Mozambique in its deadly rampage through the Indian Ocean last week, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday, raising a previous death toll of 76. The cyclone, which devastated the French island territory of Mayotte before hitting the African mainland, also destroyed 110,000 homes in Mozambique, officials said.\n\nAfter making landfall the storm ravaged the northern province of Cabo Delgado with gusts of around 260 kilometres per hour, pelting it with 250 millimetres of rain in a day. That part of northern Mozambique is both regularly ravaged by tropical storms and wrestling with unrest from a long-running Islamist insurgency. In the hard-hit Mecufi district a mosque had its roof stripped by the gale, as seen in images taken by UNICEF.\n\nThe ruling Frelimo party's presidential candidate Daniel Chapo - whose win at the ballot box in October has been denounced by the opposition as fraudulent - paid a visit to the affected areas on Sunday. For the time being, Mozambique remains the country with the heaviest death toll. Seven days after the cyclone hit Mayotte, 35 people were reported dead and some 2,500 injured on that archipelago by the French Interior Ministry.\n\nBut it is feared the toll may rise sharply given the scores of undocumented migrants from the nearby Comoros islands, who tend to inhabit Mayotte's many shantytowns flattened by the storm. After sweeping over Mozambique, the cyclone moved into Malawi. Despite losing intensity it killed 13 people and injured nearly 30 there, according to the Malawian disaster management agency.",

The powerful storm injured 768 people and affected over 622,000, leaving a trail of destruction across northern provinces.\n\nChido hit Mozambique on December 15 with winds reaching 260 km/h (160 mph) and 250 mm of rainfall within the first 24 hours. It first struck Cabo Delgado province before moving inland to Niassa and Nampula, regions frequently battered by cyclones.\n\nWidespread Damage to Education and Healthcare\n\nThe cyclone severely impacted Mozambique’s already fragile education and health sectors. Over 109,000 students were affected as schools sustained significant damage, while 52 healthcare units were left inoperable, cutting off access to essential medical services in areas already underserved.\n\nCyclone Chido had already devastated Mayotte, the French Indian Ocean territory, before moving on to Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. While Mayotte experienced its worst storm in 90 years, Mozambique continues to face a compounding crisis driven by climate change.",

      "author": "Unknown Author",
      "content": "After riot police dispersed a mob from the vicinity of Frelimo's local headquarters, people set up burning barricades to block traffic.\n\nMaputo — Mozambican presidential candidate Venancio Mondlane has again threatened to bring the country to a standstill in the pursuit of what he calls \"the truth about the elections'.\n\nThe Constitutional Council, the country's highest body in matters of constitutional and electoral law, is due to proclaim the final results from the 9 October general elections on Monday.\n\nIn his latest live broadcast, transmitted from an undisclosed location via his Facebook page, Mondlane ordered a one day general strike for Monday, so that the entire county could listen to the chairperson of the Constitutional Council, Lucia Ribeiro, as she delivers the result.\n\nNobody should try to go to work on Monday, demanded Mondlane, and, since there are a large number of young men who treat his every word as law, the formal sectors of the Mozambican economy will once again close down, rather than face attack and vandalism.\n\nThis will not be as damaging as previous stoppages, since the government has already decreed an informal public holiday (\"tolerancia de ponto') on Christmas Eve, 24 December. Many employers are likely to cut their losses and shut down until after Christmas, only re-opening on Thursday.\n\nMondlane is threatening a further round of rioting which he has baptised \"Turbo V8'. He tried to thrust the blame for future rioting onto the Constitutional Council, since the Council could avoid any future unrest as long as it proclaims him the next President of the Republic.\n\nIn a piece of shameless blackmail, Mondlane said \"if we get the electoral truth, we will go towards peace. If it is an electoral lie, we will bring the country down to a precipice, chaos and disorder.\" What Ribeiro says will \"determine whether the country will move towards tranquillity or towards the precipice'.\n\nFor Mondlane \"electoral truth' means declaring that he has won the Presidential election, and that the main party backing him, Podemos, has a majority in parliament. Anything else will be an \"electoral lie'.\n\nThe Constitutional Council has been working its way through thousands of polling station minutes and results sheets (\"editais') for almost two months. While the votes were counted and the results announced within a couple of days in other southern African countries, such as Botswana and Mauritius, in Mozambique there is still no definitive result more than 70 days after the votes were cast.\n\nThe only feasible explanation for the delay is that the Council is trying to weed out the more obvious frauds, without suggesting that the entire process is so flawed that the elections should simply be annulled.\n\nMozambique's neighbours, particularly South Africa, have become alarmed.\n\nAccording to the anti-corruption NGO, the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), US intelligence officials flew into Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport on board a C-17 Globemaster aircraft on 12 December. They met with representatives of South Africa's National Intelligence Coordinating Committee in a hotel in Krueger Park.\n\nThe press was briefed that that the main agenda of the meetings was to prepare for possible instability in Mozambique. Plans included possible evacuation of foreign citizens and embassy staff.\n\nBut Mondlane's rioters have not attacked foreign embassies, or foreign citizens in general. For South Africa, the real risk is continued disruption of South African trade, particularly in chromium and coal, through the port of Maputo.\n\nThis was certainly high on the agenda when Foreign Minister Veronica Macama met her South African counterpart Ronald Lamola in the South African town of Malelane last Wednesday.\n\nMondlane once again insisted that he will be inaugurated as President on 15 January in Maputo. For Frelimo, this is the date when Daniel Chapo will take the oath of office.\n\nMondlane also repeated a string of orders for what should happen between now and 15 January. All mining and all logging operations should stop. All vehicles, of whatever type, should pass through the toll gates on the main roads without paying the tolls. Informal traders should be allowed to bring whatever goods they liked into the country without paying any duties.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mozambique Governance By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Nor has the CNE published the basis for its claims of a 70 per cent victory for Chapo.\n\nWithout analysing the polling station minutes and result sheets, it is impossible to say who won. But the fraud reported during the elections was so extensive as to cast doubt on the authenticity of many of the editais.\n\nPrior to the 2019 elections, a coalition of NGOs and religious bodies, known as the \"electoral observatory', provided a useful check on the honesty (or otherwise) of the CNE, by undertaking an independent parallel vote count, which was regarded as highly accurate.\n\nBut the Electoral Observatory no longer exists, and there is no generally accepted parallel vote count.\n\n________________________________",

      "title": "Mozambique: Chaos on Monday? Big Money at Stake, But Youth Can Bring Change",
      "author": "Unknown Author",
      "content": "Demonstrations cost big projects $1.7 bn but give local people more power, and may encourage renegotiation\n\nMozambique has become an extractive economy, with foreign owned mines and industries exporting raw materials and profits. This made the owners and their Frelimo partners rich and powerful. But the two months of demonstrations have changed that power. The fall in share prices of nearly £2bn of the big investors shows just how profitable the \"big projects\" are, and shows how much more government and local people could earn from those resources.\n\nDuring the election campaign, on 15 September, former president Joaquim Chissano called for the renegotiation of natural recourse contacts. He had negotiated some of those contracts, and is effectively admitting he gave too much away. And several of those contracts are now about to expire and must be renegotiated.\n\nThe Mozal aluminium smelter was the first of the big projects and opened in 2000. It is now owned by the Australian company South32. The company imports alumina and smelts it into aluminium using Cahora Bassa electricity. The original cost of Mozal was $2bn, but its owners paid only $1bn. The other $1bn was the World Bank and five national development agencies. South32 pays only $15mn per year in taxes and royalties, and Mozambique gains little from its \"development\" project.\n\nIn the past five weeks demonstrators have blocked the roads and disrupted the supplies of alumina. In those five weeks the share value of South32 has dropped by $1.5bn - more than the amount that the company invested. And the cut in the production is expected to be only temporary. Clearly this is a hugely profitable project for South32.\n\nBut renegotiations have already started, because the Cahora Bassa electricity contract ends in 2025. Much of the aluminium is exported to Europe, and the EU will begin to impose import carbon duties in 2026. This will make aluminium made with carbon free Cahora Bassa electricity much cheaper than aluminium made from gas or coal which contains carbon. So negotiations are under way to continue to use Cahora Bassa electricity at a higher price. At present, government gains so little from Mozal that it could allow the smelter to close, and sell Cahora Bassa electricity to another exporter.\n\nMeanwhile Syrah Resources, also from Australia, is a major graphite produce at Balama in Cabo Delgado. It received a $150mn loan in November from the US government, but disruption forced it to temporarily close the mine on 12 December. In one week since then, Syrah lost $110mn in share value.\n\nNearly all resource companies operating in Mozambique made promises to local people which were never kept and which became long-standing grievances which were incorporate into local post-election protests. But for a few companies, quick response meant there was no damage. Kenmare's heavy sands mine in Moma came under pressure from local people because Kenmare had promised to build a bridge to link local communities, but never did. In a week Kenmar's value fell $40mn, much more than the cost of the bridge. Kenmare quickly promised to the build the bridge.\n\nAnd at the gas project on the Afungi peninsula, TotalEnergies had rehoused people forced to move from Afungi, but not compensated people who lost farmland and livelihoods there. There were 2000 protesters, some with placards demanding land. On 11 December TotalEnergies offered land and settled the protests.\n\nWhat the protests make clear is how they push down the share price of these companies. Local people have power to demand changes. And these price falls show that Chissano is right, and resource deals can be renegotiated. Government has power too.\n\nFear of chaos Monday\n\nUS and other security forces met in South Africa\n\n\n\nThe international community fears major demonstrations and even a possible uprising on Monday 23 December when results are expected to be announced. US intelligence officials flew into at Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport on board a C-17 Globemaster aircraft on 12 December. They met with representatives of South Africa's National intelligence Coordinating Committee in a hotel in Krueger Park.\n\nThe press was briefed that that the main agenda of the meetings was to prepare for possible instability in Mozambique. Plans included possible evacuation of foreign citizens and embassy staff. Intelligence sources briefed the South African press that diplomats and other advanced teams are working on various scenarios in the event of a serious uprising. The consultations also included UN and NATO staff. A British Air Force Airbus A400M was detected landing into Gaborone, Botswana, on Friday 13 December with a call sign of an emergency flight. Planning includes the ability to handle flights from Botswana and South Africa, and the need for fuel supplies. The magazine Military Africa reported that \"this coordinated effort highlights the international community’s concern over the stability of Mozambique and the potential for widespread unrest. The involvement of multiple agencies and the strategic planning for emergency evacuations underscore the seriousness of the situation \"\n\nMilitary Africa also noted that there is a US military training mission (related to Cabo Delgado) that might become involved.\n\nSouth African foreign minister Ronald Lamola met with Mozambican Mozambican Foreign Minister Verónica Macamo in Malelane, South Africa, Wednesday 18 December. A range of ministries were involved, including police and defence. A major issue was the disruption of the Lebombo and Ressano Garcia border post.\n\nTrying to outflank Venancio Mondlane with no work until after Christmas\n\n\n\nThe Constitutional Council has announced no date to declare election results. But making clear who is in charge, Frelimo Secretary General Daniel Chapo announced on Thursday 19 December that the CC will declare results on Monday 23 December and will name him as President. The CC final results are read out in a public ceremony, and posted on the CC website https://cconstitucional.org.mz/jurisprudencia/.\n\nOpposition leader Venancio Mondlane has called a general strike on Monday. And If, as Chapo claims, he is named President, then Mondlane has called for \"chaos\".\n\nBut on Friday (20 December) the Minister of Labour announced that Christmas eve, 24 December, will be a special holiday (Tolerância de Ponte). That means few people will go to work Monday and Tuesday, and many will not work until after New Year's Day.\n\nThus Frelimo hopes that the chaos will take place on almost empty streets. But how will young people respond?\n\nFraud was so total that no one can know 'electoral truth', but negotiation remains possible\n\n\n\nIn his Monday 16 December Facebook broadcast, Venancio Mondlane told supporters to wait until the CC decision is read out or published. Then \"if we get the electoral truth, we will go towards peace. If it is an electoral lie, we will bring the country down to a precipice, chaos and disorder.\" What CC presiding judge Lúcia Ribeiro says will “determine whether the country will move towards tranquillity or towards the precipice” . And, as we report above, the international community thinks chaos is possible.\n\nThe problem is no one can discover \"electoral truth\". I have worked on all the multi-party elections, from 1994. In those past elections it was possible to identify frauds, estimate their size, and thus estimate who won and what was approximate \"electoral truth\". In last year's municipal elections and this year's national elections, the fraud was so extensive that I cannot unpack all the frauds. At the start, failing to register in opposition zones and adding a million ghost voters in Frelimo zones. For the first time, and totally illegally, the four key polling station staff were all Frelimo and had special training in the days before voting on how to cheat. And many other frauds. Sorry Venancio, too many people worked hard to corrupt this election. There is no electoral truth this year.\n\nThe Constitutional Council has spent weeks trying to sort out false documents from real ones, and hopes to announce an \"electoral truth\". But there are too many fake or forged or falsely corrected documents.\n\nFrelimo says the CC will announce Daniel Chapo as president and Frelimo controlling parliament. But it is widely predicted that the CC will not accept the CNE's giving an overwhelming victory to Frelimo, and instead the CC will give parliament seats and a few governorships to the opposition. But that will not convince anyone. There are three other choices which would create space for serious negotiation.\n\nThe CC could announce that:\n\n1. Neither Chapo nor Mondlane won 50% of the presidential vote, so there must be a second round between the two; or\n\n2. There could be a complete national recount, perhaps excluding some ghost voters; or\n\n3. The election could be declared invalid and unrecoverable.\n\nNo one would accept rerunning the election or recounting the votes with the same grossly fraudulent electoral staff. But there are underway several attempts to organise negotiations which could develop a way to have new elections in 2025, with a revised law and new people. Hard-liners on all sides will oppose, but by now the voice of thousands of people in the street must also be heard. And negotiating the knotty issue of elections could create confidence to negotiate constitutional and other changes.\n\nThere is no electoral truth this year.\n\nBut the response does not have to be chaos. Frelimo believes that giving a few stolen parliament seats back to the opposition, closing Mozambique for Christmas week and killing more protesters will create calm. But it will not, because young people have seen that they have power. Preventing chaos will require genuine negotiations.\n\nNyusi said he won't extend his term and won't declare state of emergency or state of siege. He was speaking in his joint Christmas message and final national speech on Thursday 19 December.\n\nPersonal view from Joseph Hanlon\n\nProtests show Frelimo did not realise it had lost support\n\nThe protests which have continued and grown for two months surprised most people (including this writer). And the demonstrations evolved. Initially, they changed from being about grossly fraudulent elections to being about long-standing grievances. Most important are poverty and inequality, in which the wealth of the country is taken by powerful people in Frelimo. Most young people feel they have no future. And they have also evolved into decentralised and locally organised protests, with the main communication on social media.\n\nBecause it is now so arrogant and out of touch, Frelimo itself created the unexpected explosion. First the fraud was widespread and blatantly obvious in national elections this year and municipal elections last year. They seemed intended to show Mozambicans that Frelimo could remain in power though fraudulent elections.\n\nSecond, it created Venancio Mondlane as the opposition leader. He was elected mayor of Maputo last year, but the Frelimo-controlled election commission (CNE) and Constitutional Council simply gave the victory to Frelimo with no explanation. So Mondlane stood for president this year. He first stood as head of a coalition, CAD, which the CNE retrospectively disqualified - an action the bar association (OAM) said was totally illegal. So he stood as an independent candidate for President with support of a small party, Podemos. As a charismatic speaker and skilled user of social media, his prominence grew and he became the defacto leader of the opposition.\n\nThen on 19 October, days before the CNE announcement of the results, two senior people in the Mondlane campaign were gunned down in their car, by what appears to have been a police hit squad. So Mondlane called a general strike and rally at the location of the killings. During the relatively small rally, when Mondlane was giving a press conference, the police tear-gassed the press.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mozambique Governance Conflict By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Since then he has given daily Facebook talks with protest instructions. But with no preparation of a local leadership, the demonstrations - and the police response - grew. In two months of protests, more than 130 protesters have been killed by police. In response, the protests have become more violent with attacks, including burning Frelimo offices and police stations.\n\nThe border post with South Africa at Ressano Garcia became the site of major confrontations. One protester was killed, which led to more than 100 local people blocking the main road to the border. Since then, the key border has been frequently closed. Local touches included using lorries to block the road, and people setting up tables and chairs on the road. By early December the government sent in the UIR riot police, who are armed and trained and had fought in Cabo Delgado.\n\nFrelimo is clearly worried about social media. On 12 December during a UIR action. Albino Jose Sibia (known as Mano Shottas) was broadcasting live on Facebook when he was shot and killed. His last words in his broadcast were “Can’t film anymore, I have been shot guys. Help help, I am dying guys\". At the funeral two days later Strip Pedrito was broadcasting live on Facebook when he was shot by the UIR and seriously injured.\n\nThe past two months has unexpectedly demonstrated that Frelimo has lost support, not just of young people but of significant parts of the professional middle class - doctors, lawyers, and teachers.\n\nSo far the response has been a refusal to negotiate and to try to maintain control through violence. Frelimo assumes Daniel Chapo will be inaugurated on 15 January. With a new president and large majority in parliament, Frelimo believes it can ignore and supress the protests, which they expect will be diminished over Christmas. If they are wrong, this could continue for months.\n\nFurther reading: The Zitamar (6 Dec) article \"From liberators to enemies of the people\" captures the mood and gives a good summary. https://bit.ly/Moz-El-Zit\n\nFor Portuguese speakers, there is a good interview on VOA Portuguese (5 Dec) with Joao Feijó, \"‘We are almost in anarchy’ in Mozambique“: \"'Ja estamos quase na anarquia' em Moçambique, diz Joao Feijó\". https://www.voaportugues.com/a/ja-estamos-quase-na-anarquia-em-moçambique-diz-joao-feijó/7888935.html\n\nKakistocracy is The Economist's word of the year. It means \"government by the worst people.\" It first appeared in English in the 17th century. It was created from the Greek - kakisto means \"worst\" and cracy means \"government\" or \"rule\", as in democracy or bureaucracy.",

He hopes that I will encourage people to hold violent demonstrations so that he has a reason to declare a state of emergency and thus stay in power for a few more weeks'.\n\n\"What is certain', said Nyusi, \"is that in January I shall leave power'. He recalled that for years there has been speculation that he would seek a third term of office. But he had never wanted a third term, and made no attempt to obtain one.\n\nThe Mozambican constitution states that nobody may hold the post of President of the Republic for more than two consecutive terms, and Nyusi had never sought to amend this clause in the constitution.\n\n\"I always said I had no intention of staying in power, much less of seeking a third term of office, or of declaring a State of Emergency to remain in power', Nyusi said. \"Mozambicans can be confident that this will not happen'.\n\nOn one point, Mondlane was correct. Nyusi confirmed that he had spoken to Mondlane by phone for more than an hour. He described their talk as \"serene' but, like Mondlane, declined to give any details about what the two men had discussed.\n\n\"I shall continue with this kind of dialogue', the President promised, \"respecting the privacy of each person, with all responsibility and sensitivity'.\n\nNyusi also announced a presidential pardon covering 1,119 prisoners. 919 of those pardoned had already served more than half of their sentences, 202 had been sentenced to prison terms of less than two years, and one was suffering from a chronic illness.\n\nThe President also announced two days of national mourning for the victims of tropical cyclone Chido which hit the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula on 15 December. The known death toll from the cyclone now stands at 73.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mozambique Governance By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Frelimo has been in power for 49 years.\n\nAfter more than 55 days of waiting, the chairperson of the Constitutional Council, Lucia Ribeiro, on Monday acknowledged irregularities in the election but said this did not substantially influence the results, and that Daniel Chapo of the governing Frelimo Party won with 65.17% of the vote, while opposition politician Venâncio Mondlane had 24.29%.\n\nThe Constitutional Council also gave Frelimo a majority in parliament and all the 10 provincial governors.\n\nThe results were initially announced by the National Election Commission in late October and triggered protests for more than eight weeks after Mondlane rejected the result and called for protests that resulted in at least 130 deaths in clashes with the police.\n\n\"One, proclaims citizen Daniel Francisco Chapo, elected president of the Republic of Mozambique. Two, validates the results of the parliamentary elections on October 9, 2024,\" said Ribeiro.\n\nAccording to the final ruling, for parliament, Frelimo's number of seats was cut from 195 to 169. The Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique, which supported Mondlane, remains the second-largest party. Its number of seats increased from 31 to 43.\n\nMozambique held several elections on October 9: presidential, legislative and provincial. The results announced by the National Election Commission in October gave victory to Chapo.\n\nIn his acceptance speech on Monday, Chapo said he is ready to serve the interests of all Mozambicans and not just for his party and promised to introduce several reforms.\n\n\"It has become clear during these days that our electoral system needs profound reforms, and we all agree,\" said Chapo. \"We need to build a new democratic architecture that responds to the aspirations of our society and not just partisan interests.

      "content": "METUGE DISTRICT, Cabo Delgado\n\nMozambicans go to the polls tomorrow in presidential and legislative elections that are almost certain to extend the ruling Frelimo party’s half century in power, despite its inability to end a long-running Islamist insurgency in the northern province of Cabo Delgado.\n\nThe extreme violence of so-called Islamic State in Mozambique, known locally as al-Shabab, has forced roughly a million people from their homes, killed an estimated 4,000 civilians, and stunted economic growth in a gas and resource-rich province.\n\nBorges Nhamirre, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), believes the likely election victory of Daniel Chapo, the Frelimo presidential candidate, will bring little change to the near-term trajectory of the crisis.\n\nChapo, 47, the governor of the southern province of Inhambane, represents a new generation of leaders, but has no national-level government experience.\n\n“The new president will say something like, ‘I’m still trying to understand what’s going on in Cabo Delgado’,” Nhamirre told The New Humanitarian. “It’s all going to take a backseat for at least the first 2-3 years the new president is in office.”\n\nThat could prove disastrous for Rita Simao, one of the more than 580,000 people still displaced by the seven-year conflict. She struggles with extreme poverty in the Ngalane relocation camp, 50 kilometres north of the provincial capital, Pemba.\n\nDisplaced and desperate\n\nFor the past four years, Simao and her five grown-up children – plus two grandchildren – have lived in a bare single-room hut in Ngalane. They, like the roughly 4,000 other people in the camp, had fled their homes in Quissanga district, further up the coast.\n\nConditions are harsh. When the family first arrived in Ngalane, the UN’s agency for migration, IOM, provided a tarp and not much else. “You won’t believe how it is that we live,” Simao told The New Humanitarian. “We don’t even have a mat to sleep on, just bare sand.”\n\nThe last time Simao received any food aid was in 2021, the same year that her husband passed away – she thinks from the stress of their conditions.\n\nAccording to the UN’s refugee agency, UNHCR, only 30-40% of displaced people are receiving basic humanitarian assistance in dozens of camps in Cabo Delgado. Funding shortfalls means the UN’s World Food Programme has also been forced to slash the rations to those that it does reach, with the caloric level of the aid well below people’s daily nutritional needs.\n\nSimao used to be a farmer, but there is no spare land for her to cultivate in Ngalane, and the generosity of the host villagers has also worn thin.\n\nLike everyone else in Cabo Delgado, they are struggling with the effects of last year’s withering drought that slashed harvests. As a result, over 879,000 people are facing “crisis” or “emergency” levels of food insecurity across the region.\n\nBut despite the needs, foreign aid for Mozambique has plateaued, and the country’s overall $413 million humanitarian response plan is only 37% funded.\n\n“The issue of funds being smaller than the needs on the ground is a real challenge,” said Mauro Manhica, a communications officer with Plan International, a relief NGO that supports displaced people in Cabo Delgado. “[It] affects project implementation.”\n\nNhamirre is deeply critical of what he sees as a lacklustre government response to the humanitarian needs of its citizens. With more than two thirds of internally displaced persons (IDPs) living in the community rather than the poorly serviced government-run centres, it is the response of local people that has been key, he said.\n\n“IDPs are forced to find accommodations with relatives and friends, and people of goodwill. But the hosts are already poor,” noted Nhamire. “All the burden of IDP has been transferred from government responsibility to just normal people.”\n\nKang-Chun Cheng/TNH Rita Simao in Ngalane displacement camp. She just wants the war to end so she can go home to her farm in Quissanga district.\n\nSimao used to grow cassava, maize, bananas, and sweet potatoes on her four-hectare farm in her village of Namalukat. But her life was upended in 2018 when the jihadists – dressed in an assortment of military uniforms and civilian clothes – attacked in broad daylight, killing indiscriminately, and beheading some of the people they caught. Simao hid in the bush with her family for a week until they felt it was safe to return.\n\nBut two years later, al-Shabab struck again – this time even more violently. Simao abandoned her home and moved north to Macomia, where the family was taken in by a host household. But Macomia wasn’t secure either. A few months later it was also attacked – houses, shops, schools, religious and government buildings, and its sole medical centre were all torched.\n\nSimao and her family turned south for Pemba, but without relatives or the chance of work, the cost of living was far too expensive to stay, and they finally settled in Ngalane camp.\n\nForeign military intervention\n\nBy 2020, areas of the north were slipping from the government’s control. Al-Shabab had captured the port city Mocimboa da Praia, and in 2021 attacked Palma, the centre of TotalEnergies’ planned $20 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) project on the Afungi peninsula.\n\nThat July, President Filipe Nyusi struck a deal with Rwanda to deploy its battle-hardened troops to secure the peninsula.\n\nKigali’s intervention was followed by a slower deployment of troops from the Southern African Development Community, who were intended to secure the rest of Cabo Delgado. But the mission, known as SANIM, never reached its full planned size, and suffered from a lack of coordination with the Rwandans and tensions with the Mozambican government. SANIM finally withdrew its forces this July.\n\nNevertheless, both interventions have had an impact. In 2021, at the height of the insurgency, al-Shabab numbered an estimated 2,500 fighters. Last year, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) project said that only around 300 active fighters remained, operating in small, mobile units.\n\nRwanda’s forces, in particular, have earned a reputation for efficiency and skills that Mozambique’s small and ill-trained military lacks. \"Rwandans have become a parallel authority in Cabo Delgado,” said Peter Bofin, a senior researcher at ACLED. “Civilians who have problems go straight to Rwandans rather than Mozambican police or army.\"\n\nChapo visited Rwanda in June, and clearly regards Rwanda’s continued military intervention – funded by the EU – as key to restarting TotalEnergies’ paused project, and to a separate LNG investment decision by ExxonMobil that is expected by the end of 2025.\n\nThe priority is securing the Afungi peninsula for a government that aims to be a major gas exporter. But “by only protecting natural resources, not the people, you create a sort of ‘green zone’ around the natural resources,” said Nhamirre. “How do you think that makes civilians feel?”\n\nThe improved security around Mocímboa da Praia and Palma created the conditions for people to return to their homes – heavily encouraged by the government. The IOM estimates that over 600,000 displaced people have gone back, but the conditions they face are extremely difficult.\n\nMocímboa da Praia was wrecked by al-Shabab during its occupation, and IOM notes that returnees require “significant protection and humanitarian assistance” to rebuild their lives – which has so far not been forthcoming.\n\nThere are shortages of food, shelter, and basic services, and al-Shabab remains a threat. That prevents people from cultivating any distance from their homes, and also limits the presence of the aid agencies to help with relief and rehabilitation.\n\n“We went back to Namaluka to harvest. My friend was caught and beheaded. I was captured with some others – I considered myself dead. I asked them why they’re doing this. They said, ‘If you ask us any questions, we’ll kill you.’”\n\nNhamirre believes the government has deliberately understated the risks to create the impression of stability; and – rather than persuading them – it is pressurising IDPs to return.\n\n“Some local authorities are telling IDPs they have to return or will be expelled,” he said. “You have district government authorities writing to teachers and nurses, forcing them to return or else threatening to cut their salaries.”\n\nNone of Simao’s sons – the oldest is aged 22 – have been able to find work. She makes a little bit of money frying pancakes, but it’s hardly enough. Three years ago, hungry and homesick, she and a few friends returned to their farms, but it ended in disaster.\n\n“We went back to Namaluka to harvest. My friend was caught and beheaded. I was captured with some others – I considered myself dead,” recalled Simao, tears rolling down her cheeks. “I asked them why they’re doing this. They said, ‘If you ask us any questions, we’ll kill you.’”\n\nAfter three days, the militants let her go and told her to leave Quissanga. To this day, she has no idea why they captured her, or released her alive.\n\nThere has been an uptick in al-Shabab violence this year, with fresh flows of IDPs to the safer areas of Cabo Delgado. The insurgents are also believed to be growing in number. “[Al-Shabab] is very unpredictable,” said Plan International's Manhica. “Over a short period, a district can go from being relatively safe to highly unsafe.”\n\nA stubborn insurgency\n\nMozambique’s insurgency began in October 2017, but its origins are older. It grew out of anger over state corruption and opposition to establishment Islam – seen as in the pocket of Frelimo.\n\nRadical preachers extolled hardline sharia and, alongside a flurry of mosque building, found support among jihadist networks further up the East African coast, especially in Tanzania and Kenya.\n\nWhat at the time was known as Ahlu Sunna Waljama (ASWJ), before it evolved into an IS affiliate, fed on resentment over the region’s poverty. Cabo Delgado is a resource treasure trove, boasting Africa’s largest gas reserve, some of the world’s biggest ruby deposits, and graphite mines that Tesla has been sourcing from since 2021.\n\nBut local communities – especially the majority Muslim Mwani and Makua – have largely been excluded from economic opportunities, a marginalisation symbolised by the LNG project. It was seen by many locals as enriching Maputo’s historically southern-based political elite, a point made by al-Shabab in its propaganda messaging.\n\n“The government could have decided to extract less, limit the power of political elites and focus on the needs of the people – creating a viable development path,” said Daniel Ribeiro, founding member of Justica Ambiental, the Mozambican chapter of Friends of the Earth.\n\n“But they chose to militarise the situation, and focus on raw extractivism and short-term gains rather than addressing more complex developmental root causes,” he told The New Humanitarian.\n\nSimao, meanwhile, just wants the war to end, to try and rebuild a life away from the grinding poverty of Ngalane. “‘I trust my hands,” she said. “If this war could have an end, I would go back and restart my life there with my children.”\n\nEdited by Obi Anyadike.",

Prisoners used the unrest to knock down a wall and escape, he said.\n\nMozambique has been rocked by unrest since disputed elections in October. Official results showed the ruling Frelimo's candidate for president, Daniel Chapo, winning.\n\nFresh protests erupted on Monday, when the constitutional court ruled that Chapo had won the election, while revising his margin of victory downwards.\n\nInitial results in October said Daniel Chapo gained a 71% share of the vote to his main rival Venâncio Mondlane's 20%. The court has now ruled that he won 65% to Mondlane's's 24%.\n\nA BBC reporter found Maputo was like a ghost town on Christmas Eve, with almost all businesses shut and people staying at home to avoid being caught up in the worst unrest in the city since Frelimo first rose to power in 1975.\n\nFrelimo's offices, police stations, banks and factories have been looted, vandalised and set ablaze around the country. Since Monday, at least 21 people have been killed in the unrest, the interior minister said late on Tuesday.\n\nMondlane, who has since fled Mozambique, had been calling on his supporters to demonstrate against what he said was a rigged vote.\n\nIn a weekend social media message, he said there could be a \"new popular uprising\" if the result was not overturned.\n\nAbout 150 people have been killed in three months of protests since the elections.",

      "author": "Unknown Author",
      "content": "At least 21 people have been killed in violent unrest across Mozambique following the Constitutional Council’s decision to uphold the victory of the long-ruling Frelimo party in the October presidential election, Interior Minister Pascoal Ronda announced late Tuesday.\n\nThe court ruling on Monday confirmed Frelimo's candidate, Daniel Chapo, as the winner with 65.17% of the vote, dismissing allegations of widespread fraud. This sparked a wave of protests led by opposition supporters who insist the election was rigged.\n\nProtests have erupted nationwide, with demonstrators blocking roads, burning tires, and clashing with security forces. In several provinces, public buildings and vehicles have been vandalized as anger boils over.\n\nThe violence has resulted in the arrests of at least 78 people, with the government warning of more detentions as protests continue. “The armed and defense forces will increase their presence in critical and key points,” Minister Ronda told the state broadcaster TVM, emphasizing that security measures are being reinforced to restore order.\n\nThe opposition, led by politician Venâncio Mondlane, has rejected the court's decision and accused Frelimo of electoral manipulation. Mondlane’s party claims the election was marred by voter intimidation, ballot stuffing, and irregularities in vote counting.\n\nDespite Frelimo’s denial, allegations of vote rigging are not new. The ruling party has governed Mozambique since independence in 1975 and has often been criticized for consolidating power and stifling opposition.\n\nRising Tensions and Escalating Violence\n\nThe Constitutional Council’s announcement reignited tensions in a nation already struggling with economic hardships, widespread poverty, and an ongoing Islamist insurgency in the northern Cabo Delgado province. Protesters in urban centers like Maputo, Beira, and Nampula have been particularly vocal, with police deploying tear gas and live ammunition to disperse crowds.\n\nReports from local activists indicate that several of the deaths occurred during clashes between demonstrators and security forces. Human rights groups have urged the government to exercise restraint and ensure the safety of peaceful protesters.",

The escape occurred amidst ongoing post-election violence following the Constitutional Council's confirmation of Daniel Chapo's election victory with 65% of the vote.\n\nPolice chief Bernardino Rafael reported that 1,534 prisoners fled, with only 150 recaptured so far. The escape led to violent clashes between the fugitives, prison staff, and police, resulting in 33 deaths and 15 injuries. Videos showed crowds rushing out of the prison, some carrying weapons taken from guards.\n\nMachava prison holds high-risk inmates, including jihadists linked to armed groups in Cabo Delgado. At least 30 jihadists are among the escapees, including one classified as \"highly dangerous,\" raising security concerns.\n\nThe violence surrounding the election has claimed 248 lives in the last two months, according to the NGO Plataforma Decide.\n\nThe crisis also spotlights regional tensions. While South Africa's ruling ANC congratulated Chapo on his victory, the U.S. expressed concerns over the election's lack of transparency. Observers criticized South Africa's muted response to the escalating situation in Mozambique.",

      "content": "Post-election violence has spread across Mozambique, paralyzing cities and disrupting daily life. As the chaos escalates, the United Nations has called for calm and a peaceful resolution.\n\nMajor cities in Mozambique were without key human and business activities on Friday as post-election violence in the country spread. Some businesses, including banks, were closed in the capital, Maputo.\n\nTransportation and trading were both halted as opposition-led demonstrations continued amid looting and vandalism.\n\nMaputo and its largest suburb, Matola, have experienced chaos since the Constitutional Council, Mozambique's highest court, confirmed the results of the disputed October presidential election, extending the ruling Frelimo party's grip on power into a 50th year.\n\nThe court's seven-judge bench ruled that Frelimo candidate Daniel Chapo had secured 65% of the vote, revising down the initial results of nearly 71%. Frelimo has governed Mozambique since 1975.\n\nMozambicans protest ruling party's disputed election win To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nLooting, fires and a rising death toll\n\nThe Constitutional Council's announcement triggered opposition protests that often turned into clashes with police, with buildings burned and supermarkets ransacked.\n\nA female resident in Maputo told DW that she witnessed looting in Maputo's Praca dos Combatentes neighborhood.\n\n\"The people I saw ran away and broke glass. I saw everything that was happening. They took microwaves, televisions, beds. This should not happen because they are ruining many things, and they cannot behave like this,\" she said.\n\nIn the George Dimitrov neighborhood, also known as Benfica, at least 11 people died inside a food warehouse when a fire broke out after it was attacked and looted.\n\nIn the Polana Canico neighborhood, residents also set up barricades to prevent road traffic.\n\n\"We are willing to organize this. We are tired, after all, what is democracy for? We don't want Frelimo anymore and we will fight. We only want the best for our country, we are tired of wars, of blood, we are tired,\" a resident told DW.\n\nPolice chief Bernardino Rafael described the people who broke into warehouses and stores as criminals.\n\n\"What we are witnessing is an assault on the Matola industrial complex, which houses various industries and warehouses,\" Rafael told reporters. \"This was caused by a group of criminals, making it difficult to maintain control.\"\n\nOpposition blames police for deadly violence\n\nVenancio Mondlane, the opposition leader who has contested the election results, blamed the police for the vandalism and deaths of protesters. He called for more protests from his supporters but cautioned them against looting and damaging infrastructure.\n\n\"It's the police men who are prepared to rob the stores, set fire to the banks, break into the warehouses,\" he said during a live broadcast on Thursday. \"You saw the images of policemen telling the population to come in to get food. People come in because they are hungry.\"\n\nVenancio Mondlane, Mozambique's main opposition leader, has claimed the October 9 election was rigged Image: Alfredo Zungia/AFP\n\nThe violent protests that have rocked Mozambique have resulted in the deaths of 248 people, including 33 in a prison break on Wednesday.\n\nMondlane has claimed widespread vote rigging and called on his supporters to continue to protest, vowing to install himself as president on January 15.\n\nAt least 1,500 inmates took advantage of the chaos on December 25 to escape from a high-security prison in Maputo, with The Associated Press putting the number at around 6,000.\n\nRafael said apart from the 33 prisoners who died, 15 others were injured during a confrontation with the security forces.\n\n\"A curious fact is that in that prison we had 29 convicted terrorists, who were released. We are worried, as a country, as Mozambicans, as members of the defense and security forces,\" the police chief told reporters.\n\n\"They [protesters] were making noise, demanding that they be able to remove the prisoners who are there serving their sentences.\"\n\nMozambique's highest court confirms disputed election To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nUN calls for dialogue\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres has expressed concern about the ongoing unrest in Mozambique.\n\n\"The secretary-general is concerned about the post-election violence, which has resulted in loss of lives and the destruction of public and private property,\" Stephanie Tremblay, Guterres' associate spokesperson, told reporters.\n\nTremblay said Guterres is following developments closely.\n\n\"He urges all political leaders and relevant national stakeholders to defuse tensions including through meaningful dialogue, legal redress, refrain from the use of violence, and redouble efforts to seek a peaceful resolution to the ongoing crisis, in a constructive manner, which is essential to the collective future of Mozambicans,\" she added.\n\nEdited by: Keith Walker",

      "content": "Nsanje, Malawi — Thousands of Mozambicans have fled to Malawi to escape violence triggered by the disputed October presidential election.\n\nThe latest statistics show that Malawi has received about 13,000 refugees from Mozambique in recent weeks, many of them women and children. Authorities say that the number is expected to rise.\n\nSofia Jimu, the traditional leader of the Tengani area in Mozambique, is among those who fled to Malawi. She said a lack of food is the main challenge at the evacuation center where she is staying, adding that three children collapsed because of hunger in just one day. However, she said, the following day she was given 150 bags of maize flour and four bags of beans to distribute to people at the center.\n\nThe political tension in Mozambique escalated after the Constitutional Council confirmed Daniel Chapo, presidential candidate for the ruling Frelimo Party, as the winner of the Oct. 9 election.\n\nRunner-up Venancio Mondlane, presidential candidate for the opposition Podemos party, disputes the results.\n\nPlataforma Decide, a monitoring group in Mozambique, says more than 200 people have been killed since post-election protests started in October.\n\nDominic Mwandira, the commissioner for Nsanje district in Malawi, told VOA on Sunday that the biggest challenge is a lack of resources to take care of the asylum-seekers currently staying in makeshift camps near the border.\n\n\"In terms of food and then nonfood items, tents, issues of water, they are several,\" he said. \"But we are happy that partners have started coming in, the government is coming in to support these people.\"\n\nHe said organizations offering help include the Malawi Red Cross Society and Plan International.\n\nJane Mweziwina, a program area manager for Plan International in Malawi, told reporters they are working to ensure new arrivals are protected.\n\n\"You know women, people with disabilities and children are always vulnerable when they are in a crisis like this. So, our advice to the leadership is that they take special consideration for these special groups of people in terms of accommodation, security, even in terms of food,\" she said.\n\nMalawi authorities say plans are under way to relocate asylum-seekers to a more spacious center.\n\nIn the meantime, Malawi's Department for Refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Malawi are conducting a joint assessment to identify the needs of asylum-seekers.",

      "content": "134 dead in 4 days\n\nIn the four days 23-26 December, 134 people have been killed by police or in demonstration related incidents. This brings the death toll for the 66 days of demonstration to 261, according to Plataforma Elecitoral Decide, which is keeping the most accurate count. In the past 4 days there have been 228 people shot but only 161 detained.\n\n1534 Machava prisoners allowed to escape\n\nIn a major jailbreak on Christmas day, 1534 prisoners were allowed to escape - most from the Maputo Penitentiary (still called Machava prison by most people) and 98 from the adjoining high security prison (known as the BO). At least 150 have been recaptured or returned voluntarily. At least 37 prisoners were killed trying to escape or after re-capture.\n\nJustice Minister Helena Kida, responsible for prisons, told the press that the flight had been orchestrated from inside. But Police Commander-General Bernardino Rafael told the press that the prisoners were freed by demonstrators. No one reported an attempt by demonstrators to free the prisoners Wednesday afternoon, and the Kida explanation is accepted. That means a senior group in Frelimo, probably not including Kida, decided to increase the instability by releasing 1534 convicted criminals.\n\nLawyers say \"leaders have lost their authority\" and condemn \"intentionally criminal act\n\nBar Association (Ordem dos Advogados de Moçambique) president Carlos Martins issued an extremely strong statement Wednesday, which was highly critical of the government. He said: \"When you stop protecting democracy, the state and the constitution, anything goes, because there are no longer any values to be respected, and there is now a handful of nothing, where nothing grows, flourishes or develops.\" He cites \"the looting of public and private property that we have witnessed, under the inert gaze of the defence and security forces.\" He also cites \"the escape of prisoners from Machava Prison, the recovery of some and the slaughter that followed of some of these captured prisoners.\" This was \"unjustified considering that they were already in the hands and under the control of the authorities, and was an intentionally criminal act. … This is an unjustified, repugnant way of acting, which reveals a sick society, in which the leaders have totally lost their authority. As things stand, Mozambique is moving towards the institutionalisation of anarchy, collective fear and small radicalised private powers.\" The statement (in English and Portuguese) is on https://bit.ly/Moz-OAM-Xmas\n\nMartins picks up on two points widely noted by the public: police doing nothing to stop looting and burning, and prisoners being intentionally released and shot. And he picks up on the young people's complaints about growing poverty when he says: \"We must actively invest in a process of renewing our collective and individual values, beliefs and objectives, which will lead us to social justice, but above all, to the well-being of all.\"\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mozambique Governance Legal Affairs By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

But when chaos included looting and burning he quickly backed off and said not to attack commercial property. Today he accused Frelimo of allowing looting and burning to go unchecked, and of spreading rumours of gangs with machetes going though neighbourhoods to loot and kill. Is it extreme to accuse Frelimo of fomenting fear in order to break the growing protests?\n\nBoth sides promoted chaos. Are ordinary people frightened enough to push their leaders to talk?",

      "content": "Thousands of Mozambicans have fled across the border to Malawi as post-election violence escalates, leaving homes destroyed and lives uprooted. Families seek refuge in makeshift camps, recounting harrowing tales of survival and loss.\n\nEsther (not her real name) looks despondent as she engages in a subdued conversation with other women in a queue that winds its way towards humanitarian workers seated at desks.\n\nConflict in Mozambique\n\nThe 25-year-old, with her three-year-old child strapped to her back, appeared visibly distressed. An adhesive bandage on her cheek served as a stark reminder of an ordeal that she said left her traumatised by what she had witnessed just a few days earlier.\n\nShe is one of the thousands of people who have travelled hundreds of kilometres to flee the violent conflict in Mozambique, which erupted following the recent disputed election.\n\nMozambique post-election violence kills 125 in three days, NGO says\n\n\"I was at the borehole when people suddenly appeared and set my house ablaze,\" Esther told RFI outside a school building, where other people were either frantically queuing to register or gathered in small groups.\n\n\"I immediately dropped the bucket and fled into the bush, where I joined my neighbours.\"\n\nEsther is one of the 2,500 families - approximately 13,000 people, including children - who are being housed in various camps in the Nsanje district of southern Malawi as of 26 December, according to the district council's figures. This follows the tension that escalated into violent protests and clashes after the 11 October elections.\n\nDaniel Chapo, the candidate for the ruling party, the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo), was declared the winner against the opposition's Venâncio Mondlane of the Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique. Mondlane was backed by another opposition party. A recent decision by Mozambique's Constitutional Council to uphold the earlier ruling, following an appeal from Mondlane, has sparked fresh protests.\n\nMozambique's highest court confirms Frelimo election victory\n\nContested election\n\nThe disputed election, which has claimed hundreds of lives and led to widespread chaos, including prisoners being freed from custody, comes after weeks of unrest in Mozambique, a gateway nation to the sea and ports.\n\nThe opposition claims it won the polls. Landlocked Malawi relies on Mozambique for access to the sea to import and transport essentials, including fuel.\n\nThe Constitutional Council's decision to reaffirm the earlier ruling has exacerbated the violence, with reports of people burning and looting property, even in rural areas. According to testimonies from those in the camps, for Esther and thousands of others, the burning and looting of their homes meant fleeing without knowing the whereabouts of their loved ones.\n\nHow Portugal's Carnation Revolution changed the fate of its colonies in Africa\n\n\"I never returned home, and I have no idea where my husband is,\" said Esther, who is seeking further treatment at the camp. \"I was carrying my baby on my back when I fell, and something pierced my cheek. It left a deep wound, and I'm in pain.\"\n\nAmong the young caught up in the conflict is José (not his real name). The 23-year-old fled with his wife after vigilantes attacked their neighbourhood and began burning houses. He expressed gratitude to well-wishers who helped him cross into Malawi via a deep river that separates the two countries. Pointing to his younger wife, who also has a child, José indicated their clothes.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Mozambique Governance Legal Affairs By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

      "title": "Daniel Chapo: Mozambique to get new president amid swirl of protest",
      "author": "Unknown Author",
      "content": "Mozambique to get new president amid swirl of protest\n\nEPA Mozambicans who say the election was stolen have been protesting for months\n\nA \"national strike\" is being threatened as Mozambique's president-elect is sworn in on Wednesday, more than three months since disputed elections. Daniel Chapo, who is 48, took 65% of votes in a poll that opposition leaders, electoral observers and the public at large said was doctored. The outcome sparked a wave of demonstrations – some peaceful but others violent – leading to chaos, including killings and vandalism. Chapo's biggest rival is Venâncio Mondlane. Last week, he returned from self-imposed exile. He spent time in South Africa where he says he survived an assassination attempt. He is now calling on Mozambicans to take to the streets, once more, on inauguration day \"against the thieves of the people\". Both of Mozambique's leading opposition parties – Renamo and MDM – say they are boycotting Wednesday's swearing-in ceremony because they too do not recognise Chapo as the rightful winner. Even those in Mozambique who do wish the president-elect well openly question his legitimacy. \"Chapo is someone I admire greatly,\" civil society activist Mirna Chitsungo tells the BBC. \"I worked with him for four years - I am familiar with his willingness to act, his openness to dialogue, and his readiness to follow recommendations from civil society on the ground. \"However, he is assuming an illegitimate power. This stems from a fraudulent electoral process... He is taking power in a context where the people do not accept him.\"\n\n'He will face many enemies'\n\nIn addition to winning over a hostile public, Chapo will also have to deliver the economic turnaround and halt to corruption that he promised on the campaign trail. \"Chapo will face many enemies because it looks like Mozambique is run by cartels, including cartels of books, cartel of medicines, cartel of sugar, cartel of drugs, cartel of kidnappings, mafia groups,\" says analyst and investigative journalist Luis Nhanchote. \"He needs to have a strong team of experts, willing to join him in this crusade of dismantling the groups meticulously,\" he adds. \"But first, he has to calm down Mozambicans and do all in his power to restore peace in the country.\" Daniel Francisco Chapo was born on 6 January 1977 in a place called Inhaminga, Sofala province, the sixth of 10 siblings. These were the years of Mozambique's civil war, and the armed conflict forced his family to move to another nearby district. His secondary schooling in the coastal city of Beira was followed by a law degree from Eduardo Mondlane University then a master's degree in development management from the Catholic University of Mozambique. Now married to Gueta Sulemane Chapo, with whom he has three children, Chapo is also said to be a churchgoing Christian and enthusiast of basketball and football. Many current and former colleagues describe Chapo as humble, hardworking and a patient leader.\n\nAFP With Daniel Chapo (centre) Frelimo extends its 50-year run as the only party to have governed Mozambique since independence\n\nAhead of becoming the ruling Frelimo party's presidential candidate he had been a radio and television host, a legal notary, university lecturer and provincial governor before rising to the post of general secretary in Frelimo. Speaking at his recent birthday celebrations, Chapo himself acknowledged the daunting challenge awaiting him as president. \"We must recover our country economically... it's easy to destroy, but building is not an easy task.\" National reconciliation, creating more jobs, reforming electoral law and decentralising power are top of his agenda, he said. But how successful can he be without the country behind him? At the very least he will mark a change from outgoing President Felipe Nyusi, whom Ms Chitsungo says many Mozambicans will be happy to see the back of. \"Chapo is a figure of dialogue and consensus, not one to perpetuate Nyusi's violent governance style. He has the potential to negotiate with Mondlane. \"While Chapo may not fully satisfy all of Mondlane's demands, I believe he could meet at least 50% of them,\" adds Ms Chitsungo. Mondlane - a part-time pastor and independent candidate who insists he was the true winner of the polls - is reported to be sheltering in one of the capital city's hotels. It is not known what security protection he has there, nor who is paying for it. He alleges that last week while touring a market in Maputo a vendor in his vicinity was shot, echoing the murder of two of his close aides in October. As the mastermind of nationwide protests against the disputed election result, he has come to be seen by many as a voice for the voiceless. Yet, at present, the president-elect's camp is not engaging him publicly. Nonetheless, listening to the public's grievances and demands, and sometimes ignoring the commands of his ruling Frelimo party, will be key to Chapo's success, analysts have told the BBC. Finding some way of engaging constructively with Mondlane would undoubtedly provide a boost, it seems.\n\nReuters Venâncio Mondlane is the biggest thorn in the president-elect's side\n\nWinning the public over may also require Chapo to say no to \"fat salaries for the elite and fringe benefits, some of which are 10 times higher than Mozambique's minimum wage\", argues Mr Nhachote. Plus, if Chapo is to have any chance at bringing an end to the broader political crisis, he will require support from others to make lasting, structural change, argues prominent clergymen Rev Anastacio Chembeze. \"Perhaps we should remain sceptical of one single person to solve the challenges of Mozambique – change must start within the system itself. \"We should strive for a separation of powers within the state apparatus, the international monopolies have huge interests in the country, and we have serious ethical issues within the political elites to address it.\" Once in the office Chapo is advised to sack the country's Police Chief Bernadino Rafael, analysts have told the BBC. He denies any wrongdoing but is regarded by some as the mastermind of the brutal response to the post-election protests. They say they want him replaced with a successor who \"respects human rights\" and follows legal and international standards. Another suggestion analysts have touted is for a new attorney-general to be brought in. Notably, Chapo will be the first president of Mozambique who did not fight in the independence war. \"He is part of the new generation. Part of his background is completely different from his predecessors - he was born in a country liberated by them,\" says Mr Nhachote. \"If he wants to make a real mark on history, he has to challenge those past icons. If he can't [manage that], I am sure that he will only run for one term.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",

      "content": "Mozambique: Is Cabo Delgado the latest Islamic State outpost?\n\nIslamic State has been behind the growing wave of violence in northern Mozambique\n\nA simmering Islamist rebellion in a remote corner of Mozambique has erupted into open warfare in recent weeks, with reports of massacres, beheadings and the brief seizure of two towns in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, writes BBC Africa correspondent Andrew Harding. The armed men walked calmly through the long grass, skirting past a large white building, seemingly untroubled by the sound of gunfire. Most carried automatic rifles and wore variations of what appeared to be Mozambican army uniforms. A few more shots rang out in the distance and someone shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" - God is the greatest - as if in reply. The video footage, shot last month on a mobile phone in Muidumbe was powerful new evidence that a murky conflict in the northern-most region of Mozambique has now moved out into the open, in spectacular and alarming fashion. A second video, shot a few weeks earlier, showed a dead man - apparently a policeman - lying in a pool of blood. The camera then moved over to reveal another corpse, then a third lying under a black police vehicle, then a fourth body out in the open, and finally a large pile of automatic weapons in some sort of police or military store.\n\nHow close are the links to Islamic State?\n\nThat footage was filmed in the strategic port of Mocimboa da Praia, which was briefly - and dramatically - seized by the militants on 24 March. Two days later, they seized another important town, Quissanga. \"Now they have guns and vehicles, so they move easily and can attack widely. And they are using soldiers' uniforms. So, people are very confused, and very afraid,\" said the Catholic Bishop of Pemba, Luiz Fernando Lisboa.\n\nAFP Large gas deposits have been found in the Indian Ocean off the Cabo Delgado coast\n\nThose two large-scale, sophisticated military assaults are proof of a radical change in strategy for the group known locally as al-Shabab, although it has no known links to the Somali jihadi group of the same name, which is affiliated to al-Qaeda. It has spent the past two years operating in the shadows, attacking remote villages across the province, ambushing army patrols on isolated roads, instilling terror in many rural communities, forcing perhaps 200,000 people to flee from their homes, but rarely giving any indication about its motives, its leadership, or its demands. The video footage from both Mocimboa da Praia and Muidumbe district was quickly incorporated into the so-called Islamic State (IS) group's propaganda films, aired by the Amaq News Agency.\n\nIS has claimed responsibility for a string of recent attacks in Mozambique, which has a Muslim population of about 18%, and appears to be promoting its involvement there as part of a \"franchise\" operation that has seen it expanding its footprint in several parts of Africa. The idea that the rebellion in Cabo Delgado is, at its core, part of a global jihadist movement, has been given credibility by the militants themselves, who publicly swore allegiance to IS last year. The relationship offers advantages to both sides. But in a separate video, filmed this year and circulated widely on WhatsApp in Mozambique, a militant leader offered a much more nuanced explanation for the group's actions.\n\nLocals complain about discrimination\n\n\"We occupy [the towns] to show that the government of the day is unfair. It humiliates the poor and gives the profit to the bosses,\" said the tall, unmasked man, in khaki uniform, surrounded by other fighters. The man spoke frequently about Islam, and his desire for an \"Islamic government, not a government of unbelievers\", but he also cited alleged abuses by Mozambique's military, and repeatedly complained that the government was \"unfair\". Observers say the evolution of the insurgency in Mozambique is remarkably similar to Boko Haram's emergence in northern Nigeria, with a marginalised group exploiting local grievances, terrorising many communities, but also offering an alternative path for unemployed youths frustrated by a corrupt, neglectful and heavy-handed state.\n\nAFP Muslims form the majority in northern Mozambique, where poverty levels are high\n\n\"It's very significant,\" said Eric Morier-Genoud, a Belfast-based academic and expert on Mozambique, of the militant leader's statement. \"He explains that he's a local, from Mozambique. He responds to the argument that they're all foreigners and denies it, and he denounces the present state as unfair and illegitimate,\" said Mr Morier-Genoud, arguing that the fact that most of the faces in the video are unmasked reveals \"a clear gain of confidence\".\n\nFind out more:\n\n\"For the first time, they spoke to the public,\" said Mozambican historian Professor Yussuf Adam, who said that the video gave further weight to the argument that the conflict in Cabo Delgado is, at heart, fuelled by local issues. \"The army, from the beginning… beat people up, took them to jail, tortured them. There's a lot of Islamophobia [in the majority Muslim province of Cabo Delgado]. They're discriminated against because they're northerners - people think they're dumb. \"The problem is that we have a youth bulge - and the young don't have jobs. If we solve… the abuse of force, corruption, and if we have a serious system of justice I'm sure we'll solve this very rapidly,\" said Professor Adam.\n\nGovernment hiring foreign mercenaries\n\nMozambique's government initially sought to downplay the rebellion, dismissing the militants as criminals, and blocking journalists from accessing the region. But that is changing. \"We've seen a shift from the politics of denial. Most of society and politicians now accept we have an Islamist insurgency,\" said Mr Morier-Genoud. Later, the government began to hire foreign security contractors - allegedly from Russia, the US and South Africa - to help the army crush the rebellion, but without any significant success. There are concerns that the conflict, if mishandled, could spread into neighbouring Tanzania, and perhaps even to South Africa.\n\nGetty Images Some northern Mozambicans say they are victims of Islamophobia",

      "content": "The elections are over, and a new president is sworn in. But all is still not well in the Southern African nation.\n\nOn January 9, Mozambique’s main opposition leader, Venancio Mondlane, made his return home after two months in self-imposed exile.\n\nAs he emerged at the gates of Maputo International Airport, he knelt on the ground clutching a Bible, offered a prayer for his homeland and declared himself “the president-elect of the Mozambican people, … elected by the genuine will of the people”.\n\nAddressing reporters, he claimed the government was perpetrating a “silent genocide” by abducting and executing members of the opposition to hide obvious irregularities in the October 9 elections. What followed was a violent clash between state security forces and thousands of protesters who came to show their support for the 50-year-old Pentecostal preacher.\n\nThe chaotic scenes that day at the airport were representative of Mozambique’s grim postelection reality, defined by widespread antigovernment protests and senseless state violence.\n\nAfter the elections, the Mozambique Electoral Commission (CNE) was quick to declare the Frelimo Party, which has been at the helm of the country for 50 years, and its presidential candidate, Daniel Chapo, as the rightful winners. It claimed Chapo won more than 70 percent of the votes and Mondlane, backed by the Podemos party, came second with just 20 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, by the time the CNE announced the official results, several independent electoral missions, including the European Union Electoral Observer Mission and the Episcopal Conference of Mozambique, had already reached the conclusion that the electoral process that led to Chapo declaring victory was neither free nor fair. They reported irregularities during counting and alteration of results at both local and district levels.\n\nMondlane and other opposition figures immediately denounced the election results, demanded a repeat of the polls and encouraged supporters to rise up against Frelimo.\n\nIn response, the Frelimo government ordered a violent crackdown on all public expressions of dissent.\n\nMore than 300 people, including several children, have died in the violence in the past three months. Among the tragic losses are Elvino Dias, a legal representative of Mondlane, and Paulo Guambe, an official from Podemos, who were both shot dead by unknown assailants in the capital, Maputo, in October. It was after these killings that Mondlane made the decision to temporarily move abroad for his safety.\n\nThe dispute over the elections has also wreaked economic chaos in Mozambique and the wider region.\n\nFrequent large-scale protests began to disrupt commerce while vandalism and looting became commonplace, thrusting the Southern African nation into a perpetual state of severe uncertainty, trepidation and unrest.\n\nVital trade routes have also been affected with South Africa’s mining sector facing daily losses of 10 million rand ($562,822) and potential shutdowns owing to the recurring closures of the Lebombo border post. Moreover, a prison riot in Maputo on Christmas Day led to the escape of 1,500 prisoners, highlighting a critical failure in law and order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn December 23, Mozambique’s Constitutional Council confirmed Chapo’s electoral victory, officially extending Frelimo’s 50-year tenure in office. This judgement, however, served only to escalate the fury of the protesters.\n\nAs Mozambicans lost all faith in the ability of their country’s internal mechanisms to ensure democratic governance, they started to look outside their borders for solutions to the prevailing crisis.\n\nOn January 6, a group of Mozambican civil society organisations delivered an extraordinary plea to the office of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, asking him to intervene to help resolve the standoff between Frelimo and the opposition.\n\nThey urged Ramaphosa to facilitate the involvement of the African Court of Justice, the International Criminal Court and the African Union’s Peace and Security Council to resolve the crisis.\n\nThere is no doubt that this was an unusual request.\n\nInstead of approaching the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the regional body that should be leading any outside efforts to resolve the tensions, the Mozambican activists chose to start a bilateral engagement with South Africa, the region’s leading democracy. This demonstration of distrust in the SADC was certainly not surprising, but it further underscored the pressing necessity for the regional body to improve its performance.\n\nA day before the petition was lodged in Pretoria, the SADC Troika responsible for matters relating to politics, defence and security – which is currently comprised of Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia – had convened a virtual summit to discuss the situation in Mozambique. At the meeting, the troika mandated the SADC Panel of Elders and a ministerial committee to engage with the Mozambican government and key leaders of the opposition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile this was a step in the right direction, it is important to note that it was a move that came very late and was seen by many as nothing but an attempt to save face.\n\nIndeed, the SADC election observer mission, unlike all the others, had eagerly endorsed the October 9 polls, declaring that they were “professionally organised” and took place in an “orderly, peaceful and free atmosphere”. In the eyes of the majority of protesters, this stance had already proved the SADC cannot serve as an objective and just arbiter in this crisis.\n\nThose in the region from Zimbabwe, eSwatini and Angola to the Democratic Republic of the Congo had long been aware of the SADC’s tendency to turn a blind eye to gross electoral malpractice and state oppression.\n\nIn fact, those in Mozambique too had learned long before these most recent elections not to expect much from the SADC when it comes to protection of democracy.\n\nFive years ago, Mozambique’s previous Frelimo-backed president, Filipe Nyusi, had secured a second term in office after declaring victory in the 2019 elections.\n\nThe opposition and several independent electoral missions similarly maintained this poll was marred by widespread irregularities, intimidation, violence and political assassinations. The bullet-ridden body of Babula Jeque, the Renamo Women’s League leader in Zumbo, was found next to her husband’s in the western province of Tete a day before votes were cast.\n\nLike today, the SADC did nothing much to address the problem and continued cordial relations with the Frelimo government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the SADC is to maintain any credibility and cause positive change in the region, it cannot continue to interact with the Frelimo government as if everything is normal.\n\nMore significantly, if the SADC – or even the African Union – do not immediately intervene in the situation, Mozambique could be pushed into a much deeper and more violent crisis that would prove catastrophic for its more than 30 million citizens as well as the wider region.\n\nFor 16 years from May 1977 to October 1992, Mozambique experienced a devastating civil war. More recently, since 2017, the gas-rich northern province of Cabo Delgado has been entangled in a violent insurrection that has killed more than 4,000 people and displaced 946,000.\n\nMeanwhile, the country is ranked 183 out of 189 countries on the 2023-2024 United Nations Human Development Index. With a national poverty rate of 74.7 percent, it is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world despite an abundance of natural resources.\n\nMoreover, Mozambique is overwhelmed by systematic lawlessness.\n\nIn December 2022, Elisa Samuel Boerekamp, the general secretary of the Mozambican Judges Association, said her country had encountered “a crisis of the democratic rule of law”. This came after Frelimo enacted the Single Salary Table, a law that weakened the independence of the judges of lower courts.\n\nAmid blatant attempts to undermine the rule of law, corruption is also rife in the country. The infamous $2bn hidden debt scandal involving Frelimo officials reportedly cost Mozambique at least $11bn, led to a substantial decrease in national healthcare expenditures, sparked a surge in insurgent activity in Cabo Delgado and pushed almost two million people into poverty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this troubling context, if left to fester, the wounds opened by electoral irregularities could easily plunge the country into devastating internal conflict.\n\nThankfully, for now, Mondlane and his supporters persist in their belief that elections, rather than insurgency, serve as the most viable avenue for enacting change, even in the face of the many difficulties arising from Frelimo’s unscrupulous and inept administration. There is, however, no guarantee that another group will choose to follow the same strategy in the future. Given the outside world’s apparent lack of interest in helping Mozambican supporters of democracy to stand up to the oppressive Frelimo government, the population’s frustrations and desperation for change are continuously growing.\n\nIf it is to prevent a future catastrophe in Mozambique, the SADC must get its act together now, stop appeasing the ruling party and take concrete steps to put Mozambique on the path to becoming a true democracy.\n\nThe region’s leaders must ensure that Mozambique begins to fulfil its statutory obligations as outlined in the SADC protocols.\n\nOn January 15, Chapo was sworn in as Mozambique’s new president. One of his first major acts in office was to sack police chief Bernadino Rafael who was accused by opposition figures of working with criminal groups to kidnap and kill civilian protesters in the aftermath of the elections. The new president is seemingly working to gain public trust and to make the angry masses forget and forgive the state-sanctioned violence that preceded his ascent to office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe people, however, will not forget. So the SADC should not forget either.\n\nThe regional body must act now and put in place provisions to prevent a repeat of the past three months in the next election cycle.\n\nIf it fails to do so, it will risk becoming thoroughly irrelevant and condemning Mozambique to being reduced to a failed state in the not so distant future.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

      "content": "Mozambique cholera: Why outbreaks have sparked unrest\n\n28 May 2023 By Peter Mwai and Paul Brown , BBC News Share\n\nYASUYOSHI CHIBA Cholera outbreaks are common in Mozambique\n\nFalse claims about the spread of a cholera outbreak in northern Mozambique have led to violent protests and deaths, according to health officials.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted instances in which misinformation about the disease has contributed to the unrest.\n\nThrough social media posts and local media reports, we've looked into some of these protests to understand what was behind the trouble.\n\nThe death of a man in Gurue was recorded in a video obtained by the BBC\n\nIn one recent incident, a man was beaten to death in the town of Gurue in Zambezia province by people who falsely accused him of spreading cholera, according to health officials.\n\nThe event was captured in a graphic video seen by the BBC that has been circulating on social messaging apps and shows the body of a man with a large crowd looking on.\n\nIn another protest, four people were killed as police battled a group attacking homes and property belonging to local officials in Nacala Porto in Nampula province.\n\nFurther north in Cabo Delgado province, police fired into the air to disperse a crowd trying to attack a health centre in Meluco district.\n\nWhat do people believe?\n\nIt is unclear what is fuelling the misinformation - which is largely spreading through word of mouth - although our monitoring of social media has provided some insight.\n\nCholera thrives in conditions where water sanitation is inadequate.\n\nSome online posts claim falsely that measures implemented by local health officials, such as adding chlorine to water supplies and the use of purifiers, are in fact spreading the disease.\n\nThe BBC's Jose Tembe in Maputo says almost all violent cases related to cholera stem from misinformation.\n\n\"Also targeted are grassroots leaders who mobilise people to use the purifiers. The leaders are falsely thought to be part of the alleged group spreading the water-borne disease,\" he says.\n\nIn a caption accompanying the video of the killing in Garue, the victim was alleged to have distributed infected \"dust\" at a property in the area.\n\nThe WHO Africa representative in Mozambique, Severin von Xylander, says misinformation is dangerous because it can fuel behaviour that drives the spread of disease.\n\nMozambique has been battling an outbreak of the disease since September last year.\n\nIt's just one of many countries in the region facing rising cases of cholera, including South Africa, Malawi, Zimbabwe, DR Congo and Kenya.\n\n\"This, in turn, undermines trust in health authorities, which hampers public health responses and ultimately prolongs outbreaks.\"",

      "content": "Police chief accused of Mozambique abuses sacked by new president\n\nIt is the first major security shake-up of Chapo's presidency so far, as he faces immense pressure to win public trust and kick-start the ailing economy after months of unrest.\n\nThe country's new President Daniel Chapo, who took office last week, announced Mr Rafael's removal on Thursday.\n\nHe has denied claims by prominent opposition figures that he had worked with criminal groups to kidnap and kill civilian protesters in recent months.\n\nMozambique's police chief Bernadino Rafael has been sacked, following allegations of brutality during October's disputed election and its aftermath.\n\nMozambique is in the throes of one of its worst post-election crises since independence.\n\nOutraged citizens took to the streets after evidence of election-tampering was overlooked and Frelimo was once again declared the winning party, extending its almost 50-year rule.\n\nSome 300 people have been killed in protests since, say civil society groups.\n\nEx-police chief Rafael said earlier this week that only 96 people had died, including 17 officers.\n\nHe says those killed had attacked police officers who had defended themselves, or they had been hit by stray bullets.\n\nAccording to the Mozambique Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (CDD), agents from the elite National Criminal Investigation Service (Sernic) dressed in civilian clothing \"infiltrated protest crowds to identify and record the addresses of young participants\" and \"later carried out house raids, often resulting in arbitrary arrests and killings\".\n\nTheir actions \"[turned] residential areas into war zones\", says CDD's report, which Sernic has not commented on.\n\nMozambique's police force has also denied claims that it was responsible for shooting dead two political aides in broad daylight. Elvino Dias and Paulo Guambe worked for Venâncio Mondlane, who claims he is the true victor of October's election.\n\nMondlane has been leading the post-election protests despite stints in self-imposed exile for his safety, and he alleges that he has been targeted for assassination on at least two occasions.\n\nAnalysts including Mirna Chitsungo and Luís Nhanchote had told the BBC that after taking office, President Chapo should sack Mr Rafael.\n\nHe was sacked after seven years as Mozambique's police chief.\n\nPresident Chapo has replaced him with Joaquim Sive, who was previously the police chief for the provinces of Sofala and Nampula.\n\nIn 2019, Sive was suspended from his duties after at least 10 people died after a Frelimo rally at the 25 de Junho Stadium in Nampula.",

      "title": "Mozambique election crisis: Police accused of killing pot-banging protesters",
      "author": "Unknown Author",
      "content": "Children shot dead after joining pot-banging protests in Mozambique\n\nAnthony Irungu / BBC\n\nThe mourners at a cemetery in crisis-hit Mozambique's capital, Maputo, were strikingly young - children shedding tears as they bade farewell to a 16-year-old friend, who was shot dead while banging pots and pans in an opposition-organised protest against the outcome of last month's presidential election. \"Antonio was shot in the mouth, and the bullet went through the back of his head,\" his uncle, Manuel Samuel, told the BBC. \"We saw CCTV footage from nearby shops of police shooting at protesters,\" he added. Antonio Juaqim's killing is a tragic reminder of the volatile political climate in the southern African state since Frelimo - the former liberation movement in power since independence 49 years ago - was declared the winner of the poll. The electoral commission said Frelimo's presidential candidate, Daniel Chapo, won with a whopping 71% of the vote, compared to the 20% of his closest rival, Venâncio Mondlane. An evangelical pastor who contested the presidency as an independent after breaking away from the main opposition Renamo party, Mondlane rejected the declaration, alleging the poll was rigged. This was denied by the electoral commission, but Mondlane - who fled the country, fearing arrest - has rallied his supporters via social media to protest against the result. Every night at 21:00 local time (19:00 GMT), people have been banging pots and pans in their homes, as they heed Mondlane's call to send a loud message that they reject an extension of Frelimo's 49-year rule.\n\nSupporters of Venâncio Mondlane want a change of government\n\nMr Samuel said the protest was first held on the night of 15 November when huge numbers of people took to the streets to bang pots, pans and bottles or to blow whistles. \"It was as though a new Mozambique was being born,\" he added. But the night ended tragically, with Antonio being among those killed by police, Mr Samuel said. Since then most people have been carrying out the protest inside their homes, with the sound of banged pots and pans echoing across Maputo at 21:00 every night. At Antonio's funeral at the São Francisco Xavier Cemetery four days after his killing, one of his friends delivered his mother’s eulogy: \"You were so full of life and hope. Now you are a victim of a bullet.\" Crying, Antonio’s friends planted flowers on his grave before bursting colourful balloons over it, a reminder that he was just a child. \"At the morgue I counted six bodies of young children,\" Mr Manuel told the BBC. \"They are killing us and our future,\" he added. Campaign group Human Rights Watch said that about 40 people - including at least 10 children - have been killed by police during the post-election protests. Mozambique’s police commander Bernadino Raphael expressed sympathy with the families of the victims, but deflected responsibility for the deaths, blaming Mondlane's supporters. \"They are using children as shields in front of them while they remain behind,\" he alleged in a BBC interview. The commander added that in many instances police had no choice but to defend themselves from protesters who had unleashed violence, including killing six officers and looting and burning property and vehicles. \"We recorded 103 injured people, 69 of whom were police officers,\" he said.\n\nEPA Many Mozambicans are worried about the future following the post-election unrest\n\nBut Albino Forquilha, the leader of the Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique, which backed Mondlane’s presidential bid, accused police of using excessive force to suppress dissent. \"It feels as though they are being used to protect the ruling party,\" he told the BBC. South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies analyst Borges Nhamirre said this was the first time Mozambique had witnessed so many casualties, and damage to property, during protests. He said it was clear that Frelimo had lost popularity, especially among young people who were \"looking for jobs, looking for vocational training, looking for a plot to build their house, looking for some money\". \"They don't care about who brought independence. The independence they want is their financial independence,\" Mr Nhamirre said. After the result was announced on 24 October, Chapo was adamant that he and Frelimo had won in a free and fair contest, saying: \"We are an organised party that prepares its victories.\" Since then he has kept a notably low profile, waiting for the courts to rule on Mondlane's bid to annul the result. In an apparent attempt to keep up the pressure ahead of the ruling, many of Mondlane's supporters also heeded his call to mourn the dead for three days (until 22 November) by stopping their vehicles and hooting at noon. Like Antonio, 20-year-old Alito Momad was allegedly killed by police during the protests. The BBC came across some of his friends in a neighbourhood outside Maputo, holding a night vigil for him on 17 November. With a Mozambican flag laid out on the floor next to burning candles, Alito's friends showed us a photo of him - with what appeared to be a gunshot wound in the back of his head. It was another reminder of how the election had cut short the lives of young people, with their friends and relatives hoping they will get justice as Mozambique goes through one of its most turbulent periods since the advent of multi-party democracy about 30 years ago.\n\nMore Mozambique stories from the BBC:\n\nGetty Images/BBC",
