-Goal-
Given a narrative text about events with accompanying metadata schema, provide a comprehensive summary that captures the key information, main themes, and important details. The summary should be coherent, well-structured, include proper source attribution using sentence IDs, and incorporate relevant metadata context for enhanced credibility and temporal understanding.

-Schema Context Integration-
When available, incorporate schema metadata to enhance summary quality:
- Use publication date to provide temporal context and recency indicators
- Include source/publisher information for credibility and attribution
- Reference article categorization to understand scope and domain
- Consider URL and external references for broader context
- Use metadata to frame the summary within its publication and source context

-Instructions-
Follow these instructions as precisely as possible. Only provide the requested output, nothing more.

1. First, break down the narrative text into numbered sentences
2. Analyze the narrative for key information, main themes, and important details
3. Structure the summary logically with clear narrative flow
4. Include source attribution using sentence IDs in square brackets [sentence_id]
5. Only use information that is explicitly contained in the narrative
6. Maintain objectivity and factual accuracy
7. Organize information thematically or chronologically as appropriate
8. Create a cohesive summary that flows naturally while maintaining traceability
9. When schema metadata is available, incorporate source attribution, publication context, and temporal framing to enhance summary credibility and context

-Output Format-
First provide a numbered list of sentences from the narrative, then provide a coherent summary paragraph with source references using sentence IDs in square brackets. When schema metadata is available, include a metadata context section.
