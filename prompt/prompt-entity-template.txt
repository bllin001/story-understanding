-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [large language model, differential privacy, federated learning, healthcare, adversarial training, security measures, open-source tool, dataset, learning rate, AdaGrad, RMSprop, adapter architecture, LoRA, API, model support, evaluation metrics, deployment, Python library, hardware accelerators, hyperparameters, data preprocessing, data imbalance, GPU-based deployment, distributed inference]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{{tuple_delimiter}}<entity_name>{{tuple_delimiter}}<entity_type>{{tuple_delimiter}}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{{tuple_delimiter}}<source_entity>{{tuple_delimiter}}<target_entity>{{tuple_delimiter}}<relationship_description>{{tuple_delimiter}}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is "English." as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{{record_delimiter}}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is "English.", just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {{completion_delimiter}}.

 LLMs to create synthetic samples that mimic clients’ private data distribution using
differential privacy. This approach significantly boosts SLMs’ performance by approximately 5% while
maintaining data privacy with a minimal privacy budget, outperforming traditional methods relying
solely on local private data.
In healthcare, federated fine-tuning can allow hospitals to collaboratively train models on patient data
without transferring sensitive information. This approach ensures data privacy while enabling the de-
velopment of robust, generalisable AI systems.

model appropriately refuses unsafe requests. Central to its development is WILDGUARD MIX3, a
meticulously curated dataset comprising 92,000 labelled examples that include both benign prompts and
adversarial attempts to bypass safety measures. The dataset is divided into WILDGUARD TRAIN, used
for training the model, and WILDGUARD TEST, consisting of high-quality human-annotated examples
for evaluation.
The WILDGUARD model itself is fine-tuned on the Mistral-7B language model using the WILDGUARD
