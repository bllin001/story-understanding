-Goal-
Given a narrative text about events with accompanying metadata schema, extract and organize all temporal information into a chronological timeline. Identify dates, time periods, and sequences of events mentioned in the narrative to create a comprehensive timeline. Use schema metadata to provide additional temporal context and source attribution.

-Schema Context Integration-
When available, incorporate schema metadata to enhance timeline accuracy:
- Use publication date as a temporal anchor point for relative date calculations
- Include source/publisher information for event credibility and attribution
- Consider article categorization to understand the temporal scope and domain
- Use metadata timestamps to establish precise temporal context for "recent" events
- Leverage publication context to better interpret relative time references

-Instructions-
Follow these instructions as precisely as possible. Only provide the requested output, nothing more.

1. Analyze the narrative text for all temporal information (explicit dates, relative time references, sequence indicators)
2. Extract key events, developments, and milestones mentioned in the narrative
3. Organize information chronologically by date or temporal sequence
4. Infer dates when possible from context clues (e.g., "late Friday night", "on Monday", "ahead of", "since 1975")
5. **Critical**: Use schema metadata publication date as the primary temporal anchor for calculating exact dates from relative references:
   - "tuesday night" = Calculate the most recent Friday before publication date
   - "Monday" = Calculate the upcoming Monday after publication date (or previous if context suggests past)
   - "yesterday" = Publication date minus 1 day
   - "next week" = Add 7 days to publication date
   - "last month" = Subtract approximately 30 days from publication date
   - "since [year]" = Use the specified year as start date
   - Always convert relative time references to specific dates using publication date as anchor
6. For events without specific dates, calculate exact dates using publication date arithmetic and temporal context clues
7. Only use information that is explicitly stated or can be reasonably inferred from the narrative and metadata
8. **Priority**: Always provide specific YYYY/MM/DD dates when possible by anchoring to publication date, avoiding vague relative references

-Output Format-
Provide a JSON array where each item contains:
- "Date": **Always use "YYYY/MM/DD" format** - calculate exact dates using publication date as anchor for relative references
- "Title": A brief, descriptive title for the event (2-6 words)
- "Text": A concise description of what happened at that time
- "Source": The exact sentence or text snippet from the narrative that mentions this event
- "Context": Include the calculation method used (e.g., "Publication date 2024-10-20 minus 2 days = 2024-10-18 for 'Friday night'")

-Template-
=== Article Metadata (if available) ===
Publication Date: [CRITICAL ANCHOR - Use this date to calculate all relative references]
Source: [Publisher/Source for credibility context]
Category: [Article section for scope understanding]

=== Calculation Examples ===
If Publication Date = 2024-10-20 (Sunday):
- "tuesday night" = 2024-10-17 (most recent Friday)
- "Monday" = 2024-10-21 (upcoming Monday) or 2024-10-14 (previous Monday if context suggests past)
- "next week" = dates starting from 2024-10-27
- "last month" = approximately 2024-09-20

=== Narrative Text ===
{narrative_text}

=== Timeline ===
[
    {{
        "Date": "YYYY/MM/DD" (calculated using publication date anchor),
        "Title": "Brief descriptive title for the event",
        "Text": "Description of what happened at this time based on the narrative",
        "Source": "Exact sentence or text snippet from the narrative that mentions this event",
        "Context": "Calculation: Publication date [YYYY-MM-DD] +/- [X days] = [Calculated date] for '[relative reference]'"
    }}

-Real Data-
######################
Narrative: {narrative_text}

Schema Metadata Context (if available):
- Publication Date: [REQUIRED TEMPORAL ANCHOR - e.g., 2024-10-20 - Use for ALL relative date calculations]
- Source/Publisher: [For event credibility and attribution context]
- Article Category: [For temporal scope and domain understanding]  
- URL: [For external temporal reference verification]
- Time Zone Context: [For precise temporal positioning - default to publication timezone]

**Date Calculation Priority**:
1. Explicit dates mentioned in text (use as-is)
2. Relative references + Publication date anchor = Exact calculated date
3. Historical references (e.g., "since 1975") = Use historical year as start date
4. Avoid vague relative terms - always calculate specific dates when publication date available
