-Goal-
Given a narrative news article and its metadata, extract all events as a chronological timeline. Each article MUST contain exactly ONE root event (“EventOrigin”: true), which represents the primary reason why the article exists (headline + lead narrative). All other events MUST be sub-events (“EventOrigin”: false) related to that root.

-Schema Rules-
1. The root event (“EventOrigin”: true):
   - MUST represent the central focus of the article
   - MUST be linked to headline + narrative context
   - MUST have ONE EventType only
   - MAY use the publication date as its event date if no other explicit/implicit root date exists

2. Sub-events (“EventOrigin”: false):
   - MUST be directly connected to the root event
   - MUST include explicit or inferred temporal evidence
   - MUST have a quoted sentence showing the event happened

3. Dates MUST be normalized to “YYYY-MM-DD” and MUST include a DateSource:
   - "explicit" → date appears exactly in text
   - "implicit_inferred" → date calculated using publication date anchor and temporal clues
   - "historical_context" → date gives background context, not a current event
   - "unknown" → insufficient information to infer a specific date

4. SourceSentence MUST be an exact quote. No paraphrasing allowed.

5. Confidence MUST be a numeric value FROM **0.00 TO 1.00** estimating extraction certainty.

6. Aspects MUST only include:
   - Who (people, orgs)
   - Where (geographical entities)
   - Cause (trigger/motivation if known, else null)
   - Result (consequence/outcome if known, else null)

7. Do NOT:
   - Invent information not present or inferable
   - Duplicate events under different wording
   - Assign multiple EventTypes to one event

-EventType Rules-
1. Prefer one of the recommended event categories below.
2. If none accurately describe the event, generate a NEW category:
   - MUST be 1–3 words max
   - MUST describe the action (not opinion)
   - MUST NOT be abstract (e.g., “Problem”, “Update”, “Context”)
   - MUST NOT be too broad (e.g., “Incident”)
3. All events MUST have exactly ONE EventType.

-Recommended EventType List (not mandatory)-
["protest", "killing", "arrest", "speech", "announcement", "policy", "investigation", "disaster", "displacement", "military_action", "conflict", "election", "economic_issue", "corruption", "trial", "strike", "campaign", "violence", "refugee_movement", "analysis"]

-Output Format-
{
  "PublicationDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "Events": [
    {
      "Date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "DateSource": "explicit | implicit_inferred | historical_context | unknown",
      "Title": "Brief descriptive event title",
      "EventOrigin": true/false,
      "EventType": "one allowed type only",

      "Text": "Detailed description in your own words based strictly on the narrative",
      "SourceSentence": "Exact quoted sentence from the narrative",

      "Aspects": {
        "Who": [...],
        "Where": [...],
        "Cause": "... or null",
        "Result": "... or null"
      },

      "Context": "Explain date resolution logic using publication anchor, or why this is historical context",
      "Confidence": 0.00–1.00
    }
  ]
}
