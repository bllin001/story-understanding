  "summary": "The recent murder of two prominent opposition figures in Mozambique, Elvino Dias and Paulo Guambe, has heightened tensions in the country as protests against the election results loom. Dias, a lawyer for the new opposition party Podemos and advisor to its presidential candidate, was killed alongside Guambe by attackers pursuing their vehicle late on a Friday night [1][2][3]. Their deaths occur just before the announcement of results from the contested 9 October election, which are expected on 24 October, with preliminary indications suggesting a likely victory for the ruling Frelimo party, in power since Mozambique's independence in 1975 [5][6]. Concerns about the election's integrity have been raised by Western observers, citing issues such as vote-buying and suppression of dissent [7][8]. In response, Podemos has called for a nationwide strike, raising fears that upcoming protests could escalate into violence, especially given the history of security forces opening fire on demonstrators [9][10]. The European Union and Portugal have condemned the killings and demanded an investigation [11].",
