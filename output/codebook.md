📘 Event Extraction Evaluation Codebook

Manual Assessment of News Event Timelines Generated by LLMs

(Applicable to Gemini, GPT, or similar models)

⸻

🧩 Purpose of This Codebook

This document provides guidelines for evaluating the quality of events extracted from news articles by Large Language Models (LLMs). The evaluator must verify whether:
	•	The assigned date is accurate.
	•	The root event (main trigger of the narrative) is correctly identified.
	•	The event type is appropriate.
	•	The event description is not ambiguous.
	•	The event is relevant to the article’s core narrative.

Each event is rated according to five dimensions, described below.

📌 Evaluation Dimensions

⸻

1️⃣ Date Correctness — Eval_DateCorrect (0–1)

Assesses whether the model assigned the correct event date, based on explicit or implicit textual evidence.

Scoring Criteria

Value	Meaning
1	The date is correct and properly inferred (explicit or implicit).
0	The date is incorrect, invented, or not supported by the text.

💡 Valid inference examples:
“yesterday”, “last week”, “on Monday”… as long as they are correctly calculated from the publication date.

⸻

2️⃣ Root Event Identification — Eval_RootEvent (0–1)

Determines whether the event marked as the origin or main event of the article is indeed the central trigger.

Scoring Criteria

Value	Meaning
1	It is the central event that drives the rest of the narrative.
0	It is secondary, contextual, or a consequence—not the root cause.

💡 Tip: The root event usually answers:
“What happened that caused this news story to exist?”

⸻

3️⃣ Event Type Accuracy — Eval_EventType (0–1)

Checks whether the assigned event type (e.g., killing, protest, election, announcement, arson) accurately reflects the described action.

Scoring Criteria

Value	Meaning
1	Event type clearly matches the action described.
0	Incorrect, too generic, inconsistent, or misleading.

💡 Example:
If the article says “murdered,” the type should be killing, not crime.

⸻

4️⃣ Ambiguity Level — Eval_EventAmbiguity (1–3)

Evaluates the clarity and specificity of the event description.

Score	Definition
1 = High Ambiguity	Vague, missing key actors or actions. Hard to understand.
2 = Moderate Ambiguity	Understandable but lacks detail or precision.
3 = Low Ambiguity	Clear, well-defined, specific, and informative.


⸻

5️⃣ Relevance to Article Narrative — Eval_Relevance (1–3)

Measures how important the event is to the meaning and understanding of the news story.

Score	Definition
1 = Low Relevance	Could be removed without affecting understanding.
2 = Medium Relevance	Related, but not central; adds context.
3 = High Relevance	Crucial; removing it would break the narrative.

💡 Note: Relevance is narrative-based, not moral.
A horrific act may still be irrelevant to the main story.

⸻

🧮 Final Score Computation (Event Quality Score — EQS)

Each event receives an EQS between 0 and 1.

🔢 Recommended weighted formula (prioritizes chronology):

EQS = (
  2*DateCorrect +
  1.5*RootEvent +
  1*EventType +
  0.75*AmbiguityNorm +
  0.75*RelevanceNorm
) / 6

📌 Normalization

AmbiguityNorm = (Eval_EventAmbiguity - 1) / 2
RelevanceNorm = (Eval_Relevance - 1) / 2


⸻

📝 Evaluator Comment Field

Use this to record qualitative observations, e.g.:
	•	Incorrect inferred date.
	•	Missing actors causing ambiguity.
	•	Marked as root event, but only a consequence.
	•	Misclassified event type.

🎯 General Guidelines

✔ Do not assume information beyond the text.
✔ Accept valid temporal inference when text supports it.
✔ Focus on narrative value, not ethical weight.
✔ Be consistent across evaluations.
